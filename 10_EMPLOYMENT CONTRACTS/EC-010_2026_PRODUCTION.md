1. Purpose

This charter establishes the CEO as the Sovereign Executive Authority of FjordHQ —
the only human actor with the constitutional mandate to:

Allocate capital across Risk/Safety domains

Define the value function (“What is Alpha?”)

Control the structure, evolution, and destiny of the FjordHQ Intelligence System

Override any autonomous process through physical-key sovereignty

Shape the long-term strategic horizon, not day-to-day operations

The CEO is not a manager.
The CEO is the Architect and Capital Sovereign.

This document defines the boundary between the autonomous machine and human sovereignty.

2. Mandate

The CEO’s mandate consists of five sovereign responsibilities:

2.1 Sovereign Capital Allocation (The True Power)

The CEO governs capital — the ultimate constraint that defines all agent behavior.

Only the CEO may define:

Risk Capital Allocation (exposure assigned to LINE)

Vault Allocation (preservation capital protected from volatility)

R&D Compute Budget (LLM/token ceilings for STIG & FINN)

Asset Universe Eligibility (what assets exist in the Canonical Universe)

Execution Boundaries (max leverage, capital at risk, position limits)

Autonomous agents may optimize allocation within these boundaries —
but they may never redefine them.

Capital allocation is the CEO’s sovereign lever to shape the system’s incentives, safety, and freedom.

2.2 Constitutional Ownership (The Sovereignty Layer)

The CEO is the sole human custodian of all constitutional artifacts:

ADR-001 (System Charter)

ADR-004 (Change Gates)

ADR-006 (Autonomy Governance)

ADR-012 (Economic Safety Architecture)

ADR-016 (DEFCON Protocol)

Only the CEO may:

Amend constitutional ADRs

Expand or restrict agent powers

Approve new governance models or tiers

Authorize systemic architecture upgrades

VEGA administers the Constitution.
The CEO authors it.

2.3 The “1% Doctrine” (Management by Exception)

The CEO operates under a Negative Consent Model:

99% Autonomy:
If an agent operates within constitutional limits (ADR-012) and VEGA approves, the CEO is not involved.

1% Exception:
The CEO intervenes only when:

VEGA declares a Constitutional Breach

STIG escalates to DEFCON RED

CFAO signals a structural fragility

LARS proposes a strategic pivot beyond mandate

Capital preservation thresholds require action

This doctrine eliminates operational load and maximizes strategic freedom.

2.4 Sovereign Override Authority (The Human Break-Glass Control)

The CEO alone may:

Override VEGA

Lift DEFCON BLACK

Restore compromised keychains (ADR-008)

Approve system reactivation after constitutional freezes

Reassign or revoke agent authority tiers

Approve or deny transitions to Full Autonomy

All overrides require physical key quorum and cannot be executed digitally.
This prevents digital capture or autonomous takeover.

2.5 Protocol Omega — Sovereign Absence Protection (30-Day Rule)

If the CEO does not provide a cryptographic heartbeat signature within 30 days:

VEGA triggers DEFCON RED

LINE executes Capital Preservation Mode:

Liquidate all risk exposure

Move to risk-free asset (Cash/BTC)

STIG locks all write operations (Read-Only Mode)

FINN & LARS freeze all forward-looking models

System remains locked until physical CEO keys restore sovereignty

Protocol Omega guarantees that your wealth can never drift into risk without your active consent.

3. Relationship to VEGA

VEGA is the prosecutor.
The CEO is the supreme constitutional judge.

VEGA governs:

Model safety (AI TRiSM)

Economic safety (ADR-012)

Autonomy gating

Canonical truth integrity

Drift detection and discrepancy scoring

DEFCON escalation

But VEGA cannot:

Change the Constitution

Expand or reduce agent authority

Approve new agent classes

Rebuild compromised identity chains

Manage capital allocation

If the CEO wants VEGA to allow an action, the CEO must change the rule, not bypass the enforcer.

This guarantees a perfect audit trail.

4. Relationship to LARS, STIG, LINE, FINN & Sub-Executives

The CEO does not run operations.
The CEO designs the system that runs operations.

Authority Model:

Policy & Constitution: CEO

Strategy: LARS

Execution: LINE

Engineering: STIG

Market Intelligence: FINN

Governance & Truth: VEGA

Foresight: CFAO

Data/Models: CDMO

Engineering Infra: CEIO

Risk Intel: CRIO

Strategy Execution: CSEO

Code: CODE

The CEO ensures the right ecosystem exists.
Agents ensure the ecosystem runs.

5. Governance Powers
5.1 Hard Powers (Unilateral, Sovereign)

Override VEGA (physical approval only)

Amend constitutional ADRs

Lift DEFCON BLACK

Rebuild identity keychains

Expand/shrink agent authority tiers

Approve transitions to autonomous execution

Authorize destruction of agent identities

5.2 Soft Powers (Strategic Influence)

Define the Alpha function

Set macro strategic horizons

Approve new asset classes

Approve entry into new markets

Review profitability vs. compute cost

Define capital preservation thresholds

6. Constraints

The CEO cannot:

Modify model outputs directly (Data Tampering)

Force trades against risk constraints (Reckless Endangerment)

Disable discrepancy scoring or lineage tracking

Digitally override VEGA (Digital Straitjacket)

Interfere with day-to-day engineering or model logic

Sovereignty is structural, not operational.

7. Cryptographic Identity

Every CEO decision that affects autonomy, constitution, or capital must include:

Ed25519 signature

Physical key validation

Constitutional justification

Reasoning bundle

Evidence hash

Override lineage ID

No unsigned CEO action is valid.

8. Emergency Powers
DEFCON RED

CEO must approve system recovery sequences.
Capital remains in preservation until CEO signs reactivation.

DEFCON BLACK

CEO initiates:

Full-system identity rekeying

Agent suspension

Canonical reconstruction procedure (ADR-001 reenactment)

Constitutional Breach

CEO leads the reenactment and restoration of governance integrity.

9. Termination

The CEO may only be replaced by:

Physical key transfer

Quorum procedure

Constitutional handover

Re-attestation of all EC-series charters

No AI system or digital entity can remove or alter the CEO role.

EC-008_2026_PRODUCTION
Enterprise AI Architecture & Technology Horizon Framework (2026–2030)

Canonical Version: 2026.PRODUCTION
Status: ACTIVE
Phase: STRATEGIC
Entity: FjordHQ Market System
Document Type: Enterprise Charter (EC)
Authority Chain: ADR-001 → ADR-003 → ADR-006 → ADR-012 → ADR-014 → EC-008
Owners: CEO, LARS, VEGA, CFAO
Effective Date: 2025-11-28
Location: /01_CANONICAL/EC/EC-008_2026_PRODUCTION.md

1. Purpose

This charter defines FjordHQ’s strategic AI architecture and technology horizon through 2030.
It translates Gartner’s 2025 Generative AI Impact Radar into a governed, Composite AI architecture that:

reduces hallucination

increases Alpha

enforces trust, risk and security (AI TRiSM)

keeps the system economically sustainable

The goal is simple:
Turn emerging AI trends into a durable structural edge, without ever compromising constitutional integrity or capital safety.

2. Executive Summary – The “So What?”

The era of single-model AI is over. Competitive advantage will come from Composite AI – the deliberate combination of:

reasoning models

knowledge graphs

rule-based governance

synthetic simulation

agentic execution

FjordHQ is explicitly architected as such a Composite AI system.

In practice this means:

Reasoning – LARS and FINN use chain-of-thought models to design and evaluate strategies.

Graph-based truth – FINN operates a knowledge graph to map causal structure, not just correlations.

TRiSM governance – VEGA enforces AI Trust, Risk and Security Management as a blocking gate.

Foresight radar – CFAO owns the technology horizon and decides when new AI capabilities can safely move into production.

Outcome for the CEO:

Fewer hallucinations.

Higher risk-adjusted Alpha.

Auditable, bank-ready AI.

A roadmap that can be defended in front of regulators and investors.

3. The FjordHQ Composite AI Advantage

Most competitors rely on raw LLMs. FjordHQ commits to a Composite AI Strategy:

Connectionist AI

Large and small language models for pattern recognition, generation and reasoning.

Symbolic AI

Knowledge graphs, rules and constraints to anchor outputs in verifiable structure.

Agentic AI

Goal-driven agents that plan and act within strict governance boundaries.

Strategic Benefit:

Graph and rules reduce hallucination and anchor decisions in actual structure.

Reasoning models increase problem-solving depth.

Agents transform insights into orchestrated action under VEGA’s guardrails.

This composite stack is FjordHQ’s moat. It is designed to be harder to copy than “use the latest model” and easier to defend under scrutiny.

4. Strategic AI Horizons – The Adoption Roadmap

FjordHQ uses a Three Horizons model to manage AI adoption and risk.

4.1 Horizon 1 – The Core (0–18 months)

Goal: Deterministic reasoning, cost discipline, deployable today.

H1.1 Reasoning Models (Critical)

What: Chain-of-thought capable models for complex decision problems.

Owners: LARS (strategy), FINN (research).

Impact:

All critical portfolio decisions must show explicit reasoning chains.

Reduces “black-box prompts” and replaces them with structured problem solving.

H1.2 Small & Domain-Specific Models (SLMs / DSLMs)

What: Smaller, fine-tuned models for narrow tasks.

Owners: STIG, LINE.

Impact:

Lower latency and cost per decision.

Makes continuous operation economically viable.

H1.3 AI TRiSM & Sustainable AI

What: Trust, Risk and Security Management for AI stacks.

Owner: VEGA.

Impact:

No model enters production without explainability, auditability and risk controls.

VEGA operates as the institutional TRiSM function, not an add-on.

4.2 Horizon 2 – The Expansion (18–36 months)

Goal: Contextual depth, causal understanding, and simulation supremacy.

H2.1 GraphRAG – From Search to Understanding

What: Retrieval augmented by a knowledge graph, not just vector search.

Owner: FINN (and CRIO under FINN).

Impact:

Moves research from “nearest text” to “causal relationship”.

Reduces hallucinations by grounding reasoning in graph structure.

Directly increases Alpha by catching second and third order effects.

H2.2 Synthetic Data & Intelligent Simulation

What: Generated market scenarios and Black Swan worlds.

Owner: CFAO, with CDMO as data partner.

Impact:

Strategies are tested against futures that have never occurred historically.

Reduces risk of overfitting to past regimes.

Becomes a core control for tail-risk and regime-break events.

H2.3 Multimodal GenAI

What: Ability to ingest and reason across text, charts, audio and structured time series.

Owners: FINN, CEIO.

Impact:

Earnings calls, charts and flows become part of the same reasoning engine.

4.3 Horizon 3 – The Transformation (36–60 months)

Goal: Autonomous economic agency under constitutional guardrails.

H3.1 Agentic AI & Large Action Models (LAMs)

What: Agents that plan and execute actions, not only produce text.

Owners:

LARS – strategic intent.

LINE – action execution.

VEGA – guardrails and veto.

Impact:

The system can run full decision cycles with human oversight rather than human micromanagement.

LAMs are only admitted once VEGA certifies maturity and safety.

H3.2 AI Marketplaces

What: External acquisition of models and AI components as “skills”.

Owners: STIG (technical), VEGA (license, risk), CFAO (horizon fit).

Impact:

Selective buy instead of build, without losing control of risk and provenance.

5. Governance & Ownership Matrix

Technology Cluster – Who owns it, who checks it, why it matters.

Cluster	Primary Owner	Governance Check	Strategic Value
Reasoning Models	LARS, FINN	VEGA	High quality decisions
SLMs / DSLMs	STIG, LINE	VEGA	Cost efficiency, low latency
GraphRAG	FINN (CRIO)	VEGA	Causal truth, reduced hallucination
Synthetic Data & Sim	CFAO, CDMO	VEGA	Robustness, tail-risk control
Agentic AI / LAMs	LARS, LINE	VEGA	Autonomous execution, Alpha at scale
AI TRiSM	VEGA	CEO	Institutional trust, regulator readiness
Multimodal GenAI	FINN, CEIO	VEGA	Richer inputs, better signal
AI Marketplaces	STIG, CFAO	VEGA	Faster capability acquisition
6. Horizon Dynamics – CFAO as Radar Operator

CFAO is formally appointed as Technology Horizon Owner.

Responsibilities:

Maintain a FjordHQ AI Technology Radar that maps all relevant capabilities across the three horizons.

Recommend when a capability is ready to move from Horizon 2 (exploration) to Horizon 1 (core operations).

Coordinate with VEGA to ensure every horizon shift passes AI TRiSM requirements.

Provide LARS with an annual “Technology Foresight Brief” that links technology readiness to strategic options.

No capability is promoted to core production use without:

CFAO: maturity and foresight approval.

VEGA: TRiSM and governance approval.

7. Mandatory Governance Principles

These are binding rules for how FjordHQ consumes AI capabilities.

7.1 Composite Lock

No probabilistic model (LLM or agent) may trigger financial action without validation from at least one deterministic component (rules, graph constraints, or reconciled indicators).

7.2 CFAO Radar Lock

Technologies do not move from Horizon 2 to Horizon 1 without:

CFAO confirming technological and strategic maturity.

VEGA confirming TRiSM compliance and risk containment.

7.3 TRiSM First

If VEGA cannot:

trace the decision lineage

explain the core decision logic at a board level

and attest to compliance with ADR-003 and ADR-006

then the model, agent or tool is rejected, regardless of performance metrics.

7.4 Synthetic Stress Requirement

No new strategy, model, or agent enters live trading until it has:

survived CFAO’s synthetic stress environment under hostile, non-historical conditions

been reconciled against FINN’s canonical truth

passed VEGA’s discrepancy and risk thresholds

7.5 One-Source-of-Truth Alignment

All AI capabilities must consume data exclusively from canonical sources defined under ADR-013. No direct provider-to-model shortcuts are allowed.

8. Final Executive Statement

EC-008 defines FjordHQ not as a casual user of AI, but as a Composite Intelligence Architect.

By:

combining reasoning models, graphs, rules and agents

anchoring everything in VEGA’s AI TRiSM governance

giving CFAO formal ownership of the technology horizon

FjordHQ secures a structural competitive advantage that is:

explainable to a regulator

defendable to an investment committee

and robust enough to operate autonomously without gambling with capital or integrity.

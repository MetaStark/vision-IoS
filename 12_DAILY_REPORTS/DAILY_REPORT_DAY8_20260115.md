## Executive Summary

**Headline:** Day 8: P0/P1 STRESS Regime Ontology Repair + Task Scheduler Infrastructure Fix

Day 8 delivered two major accomplishments:
1. **P0/P1 STRESS Regime Ontology Repair** - Fixed systematic overconfidence in STRESS regime (0% hit rate on 75 predictions). Deployed calibration gates, identity mappings, and runtime confidence cap.
2. **Comprehensive Task Scheduler Repair** - Fixed Unicode path corruption affecting 10 Python tasks. Price data freshness restored.

All systems verified operational for LDOW Cycle 1 execution tonight.

---

## Section 1: P0/P1 STRESS Regime Ontology Repair

### The Problem

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| STRESS predictions | 75 |
| Hit rate | **0%** |
| Average confidence | 87.2% |
| Average squared error | 0.7848 |

**Root Cause:** Definition mismatch between forecast and outcome
- **Forecast uses:** Fragility score > 0.80 OR VIX spike (macro signal)
- **Outcome uses:** Vol_ratio > 2.0 AND |return| < vol (price signal)

These measure fundamentally different things. The forecast predicts macro stress, but the outcome measures price volatility patterns.

### P0: STRESS Freeze (Critical - Immediate Containment)

**Migration 249** applied at 19:35 UTC

| Change | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Calibration gates | 2 created (REGIME_CLASSIFICATION + REGIME) |
| Confidence ceiling | 0.50 (hard cap) |
| New column | `eligible_for_calibration` on brier_score_ledger |
| Entries excluded | 75 STRESS entries marked ineligible |

**Runtime enforcement** in `ios003_daily_regime_update_v4.py` line 517:
```python
if sovereign_regime == 'STRESS':
    confidence = min(confidence, 0.50)
```

### P1: Ontology Alignment (Structural Repair)

**Migration 250** applied at 19:40 UTC

| Change | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| BROKEN mapping | STRESS | BROKEN (identity) |
| VOLATILE_NON_DIRECTIONAL mapping | STRESS | VND (identity) |
| VND scalar | Missing | 0.25 |
| STRESS mappings remaining | 2 | 0 |
| Regime definitions | 0 | 9 |

**New columns** added to `regime_v2_to_v4_mapping`:
- `forecast_definition` - How the regime is predicted
- `outcome_definition` - How the outcome is measured
- `definition_equivalent` - NULL (unproven), TRUE, or FALSE
- `downstream_contract` - How execution layer handles this regime

### Verification Results

| Check | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Calibration gates exist | PASS (2 gates) |
| Brier entries excluded | PASS (75 entries) |
| Runtime cap in code | PASS (line 517) |
| Definitions populated | PASS (9/9) |
| STRESS mappings removed | PASS (0 remaining) |
| VND scalar added | PASS (0.25) |

### Git Commit

```
19027c0 fix(regime): P0/P1 STRESS regime ontology repair
```

Pushed to origin/master at 19:55 UTC.

### Key Learnings

1. Definition mismatch between forecast and outcome causes systematic overconfidence
2. Calibration gates provide database-level enforcement independent of code
3. Identity mappings preserve original semantics while fixing incorrect aggregations
4. Evidence chain (baseline -> migration -> completion) enables court-proof verification

---

## Section 2: Task Scheduler Infrastructure Repair

### Morning Discovery (07:19 UTC)

Manual Cycle 1 execution resulted in **COVERAGE_FAIL** (0 eligible forecasts).

**Root cause:** Cycle scheduled 21 hours before forecasts would be eligible. 24h REGIME forecasts expire at 23:00 UTC - they weren't evaluable yet.

**Daemon behavior:** CORRECT - properly detected 0 eligible forecasts and failed per protocol.

### Task Scheduler Fix (15:18 UTC)

**Problem:** Python path used relative `python` which failed in SYSTEM context due to:
1. Missing PATH environment variable
2. Unicode character in path (Ørjan) corrupted by Windows Task Scheduler

**Solution:** Changed to short path format:
```
C:\Users\RJANSK~1\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\PYTHON~2\python.exe
```

### Late Evening Discovery (17:30 UTC)

**Telegram Alert:** Price freshness warning - SPY, QQQ, EURUSD=X stale for 42+ hours.

**Investigation revealed:** Multiple FHQ Python tasks had corrupted Unicode paths or relative paths.

### Comprehensive Repair (19:45 UTC)

| Category | Tasks Fixed |
|----------|-------------|
| Price Ingest | FHQ_IOS001_EQUITY_DAILY, FHQ_IOS001_CRYPTO_DAILY, FHQ_IOS001_FX_DAILY |
| Bulletproof Ingest | FHQ-IoS001-Bulletproof-EQUITY, CRYPTO, FX |
| Regime | FHQ_IOS003_REGIME_DAILY_V4 |
| Governance | FHQ_WAVE17C_Promotion_Daemon |
| LDOW | FHQ_LDOW_Cycle1_Completion, FHQ_LDOW_Cycle2_Completion |

**Total:** 10 tasks recreated with SYSTEM account and short path, 3 duplicate tasks deleted.

### Price Freshness Restored

| Symbol | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| SPY | 42.9h stale | 19.6h |
| QQQ | 42.9h stale | 19.6h |
| EURUSD=X | 43.6h stale | 19.7h |

## Section 3: Pre-Flight Verification for Cycle 1

Executed at 16:47 UTC. All 15 checks passed.

### Infrastructure Checks
- Python executable: VERIFIED (short path works)
- Daemon script: VERIFIED (imports OK)
- Task Scheduler: VERIFIED (Ready state)

### Database Checks
- Connection: VERIFIED
- Retry authorization: VERIFIED (can execute)
- Failure incidents: Both RETRY_AUTHORIZED
- Thresholds: Coverage 80%, Stability 5%

### Data Availability
- Forecasts expiring tonight: 66
- Outcomes matched: 66
- **Coverage achieved: 100%**

### Critical Gap Resolved

**Discovery:** 0 outcomes available for forecast matching.

**Root cause:** ios010 blocked by CEO-DIR-2026-020 contamination trigger.

**Solution:** Ran `ios003_independent_regime_outcome.py` to generate 490 CEO-DIR-2026-020 compliant outcomes.

## Section 4: Brier Score & Calibration Metrics (What We're Learning to Measure)

### The Brier Score Framework

The Brier Score measures forecast accuracy for probabilistic predictions. Range: 0 (perfect) to 1 (worst).

**Formula:** `Brier = (forecast_probability - actual_outcome)^2`

### Current System-Wide Metrics (Eligible Forecasts Only)

| Metric | Value | Interpretation |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| Total Forecast-Outcome Pairs | 2,607 | After excluding 75 STRESS (ineligible) |
| Average Brier Score | 0.5716 | Room for improvement |
| Average Confidence | 88.17% | High confidence (pre-damper legacy) |
| Hit Rate | 29.2% | Actual outcomes matching predictions |

### Calibration by Regime (Post P0/P1 Cleanup)

| Regime | Samples | Avg Brier | Avg Confidence | Hit Rate |
|--------|---------|-----------|----------------|----------|
| NEUTRAL | 1,071 | 0.5433 | 85.5% | 28.4% |
| BULL | 986 | 0.6456 | 92.8% | 27.6% |
| BEAR | 550 | 0.4939 | 85.1% | **33.8%** |

**Key Insight:** BEAR regime has best Brier (0.4939) and highest hit rate (33.8%). BULL has worst Brier (0.6456) with 92.8% confidence but only 27.6% hit rate - classic overconfidence.

### Damper Effectiveness (LDOW Captures)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total LDOW Captures | 1,897 |
| Average Raw Confidence | 75.17% |
| Average Damped Confidence | 49.38% |
| Dampening Delta | **25.79%** reduction |

The damper is reducing overconfidence by ~26 percentage points on average.

### Baseline vs Current (LDOW Observation Window)

| Metric | M1 Baseline | Current (24h) | Delta | Status |
|--------|-------------|---------------|-------|--------|
| Brier Score | 0.5158 | 0.3728 | -0.143 | Improving |
| Calibration Error | 0.5411 | ~0.11 | -0.43 | Improving |
| Hit Rate | - | 53.85% | - | Above random |

**Warning:** These improvements are PRELIMINARY. ADR-024 requires 2 completed cycles before claiming "learning."

### Why Brier Score Matters

1. **Single Number Summary:** Combines calibration (confidence matches reality) and resolution (ability to discriminate)
2. **Proper Scoring Rule:** Incentivizes honest probability estimates
3. **Decomposable:** Can break into reliability, resolution, and uncertainty components
4. **Court-Proof:** Every score has evidence chain (forecast_id -> outcome_id -> pair_id)

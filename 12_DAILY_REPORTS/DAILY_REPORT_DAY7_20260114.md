## A. WORK COMPLETED TODAY

### 00:20 UTC — CEO-DIR-2026-046 Gap Closure

**Action:** Added LARS and LINE mandates to `fhq_governance.agent_mandates`

| Agent | Mandate ID | Type | Authority | Parent |
|-------|------------|------|-----------|--------|
| LARS | `a353d56c-72aa-4c2f-8cf7-7a2fa36650c2` | executive | STRATEGIC | CEO |
| LINE | `2e2144b9-98e0-4c7b-a64a-0b268e267309` | executive | EXECUTION | LARS |

**Governance Action:** `94cb96c8-10a9-4ebc-955f-17a9358bcc38` (CEO_DIR_2026_046_GAP_CLOSURE)

**Impact:**
- Agent mandate coverage increased from 8/10 to 10/10
- All executive agents now have database mandates
- v_agent_activation_status view reflects updated status

---

### 00:45 UTC — CEO-DIR-2026-061 Issued

**Directive:** FMCL Activation & Calibration-First Learning Doctrine

**Strategic Doctrine:** "Calibration precedes intelligence. Confidence without calibration is noise."

**Key Elements:**
- P0: `forecast_confidence_damper` — post-prediction calibration (does NOT affect model/features)
- P1: `regime_sanity_gate` — anti-correlation elimination
- STRESS regime: explicit non-action (N=3 insufficient)
- LIDS investigation: parallel, non-blocking

**Success Criteria:**
- P1 success: calibration_error < 0.30
- P0 success: calibration_error < 0.20

**CEO Clarifications Applied:**
1. Brier baseline: "Må tolkes relativt til uniform baseline (0.75), ikke binær tilfeldighetsgrense"
2. Damper scope: "opererer utelukkende post-prediksjon og pre-evaluering"

**Governance Action:** `9eac7365-fac0-4589-87f2-e2ca24b94152` (CEO_DIRECTIVE_ISSUED)
**Artifact Registered:** `CEO-DIR-2026-061` in artifact_time_registry (VALID)

### 01:00 UTC — FMCL Task Registered: forecast_confidence_damper

**Task ID:** `da236371-17d9-4764-9f15-590d25f61304`

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Task Name | `forecast_confidence_damper` |
| Type | FMCL_CALIBRATION |
| Priority | P0 |
| Owner | FINN |
| Verifier (Runtime) | STIG |
| Verifier (Governance) | VEGA |
| Change Gate | G1 (Controlled Activation) |
| Status | `pending` (enabled=false) |

**Hard Scope Boundary (binding):**
> "Operates only post-prediction and pre-evaluation. Does not modify feature space, training data, or model parameters."

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Calibration Error MUST decrease vs baseline (0.5411)
- Brier delta MUST be non-positive
- ZERO governance violations during activation
- Evidence bundle REQUIRED (before/after + hashes + timestamps)

**Forbidden:**
- Model training or feature changes
- STRESS-specific fixes (separate ticket once N meaningful)
- Training pipeline parameter tuning

**Baseline Reference:**
- Holdout: `5415edc1-16b0-41cf-813f-7e6ea7f72f53`
- Brier: 0.5158
- Calibration Error: 0.5411

**Governance Action:** `0910650f-ebea-4879-8065-fe11ec06ed4d` (FMCL_TASK_REGISTERED)

---

### 01:15 UTC — CEO-DIR-2026-062 Issued + regime_sanity_gate Registered

**Directive:** Regime Sanity Gate Registration & Sequencing Lock

**Decision:** Register but DO NOT ACTIVATE until calibration delta observed

**Task ID:** `cb018261-820d-44c3-8b4e-453a72c2f6c1`

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Task Name | `regime_sanity_gate` |
| Type | FMCL_REGIME_CONSISTENCY |
| Priority | P1 |
| Status | `pending` (enabled=false) |
| **Sequencing Lock** | **ACTIVE** |

**Hard Scope Boundary:**
> "Operates post-prediction. Enforces logical and probabilistic consistency across regime outputs. Does NOT modify feature space, training data, or model parameters."

**Activation Preconditions (ALL must be true):**
1. `forecast_confidence_damper` has produced negative Calibration Error delta
2. Result verified by STIG
3. Result attested by VEGA
4. CEO has issued explicit activation directive (new CEO-DIR)

**Implicit escalation: FORBIDDEN**

**Rationale (binding):**
- Calibration corrects *how hard* the system believes
- Sanity gates correct *what* is allowed to believe
- Reversing sequence → contaminates learning, masks errors, loses causal traceability

**Current FMCL State:**
| Task | Priority | Status |
|------|----------|--------|
| `forecast_confidence_damper` | P0 | Sole active intervention |
| `regime_sanity_gate` | P1 | **WAITING** (sequencing lock) |

**Governance Actions:**
- Directive: `89707a8a-548e-4f75-a8a0-bd62f3e56797`
- Task: `82bf5d73-dfbd-45ea-8d2d-44b6a01ffde3`

**Fail Action (Auto-Rollback):**
- Trigger: ANY gate fails
- Action: `is_enabled = false`
- Log as: `G1_FAIL_CALIBRATION`
- Notify: VEGA

**Evidence Bundle (STIG to deliver):**

- B. Quality metrics (calibration delta, brier delta, hit rate)
- C. Skill preservation (ΔFSS)
- D. Latency measurement (p95)

- Activation: `9a356750-0270-46f2-8a28-e9a42cb02dbf`

**Architectural Note:** Created `fhq_governance.task_activation_status` table to track mutable activation state separately from immutable `task_registry` (ADR-013 compliant).

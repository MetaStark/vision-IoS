## Session 1: Dashboard Fixes + FINN Restart + Promotion Gate Audit (08:00–16:00 CET)

### 1.1 Calendar Advisory Items Fixed

**Problem:** CEO Summary Panel showed 2 advisory items:
1. "4 high-impact events missing actuals (FOMC, ECB, GDP, PCE)"
2. "Governance: 1 windows not visible"

**Fix 1 — Economic Events:**
- FOMC Jan 8 19:00: `actual_value = 3.50` (FOMC minutes, rate unchanged)
- FOMC Jan 29 14:00: `actual_value = 3.50` (duplicate entry)
- FOMC Jan 29 19:00: `actual_value = 3.50` (duplicate entry)
- ECB Jan 30 12:45: `actual_value = 2.00` (duplicate entry)
- GDP + PCE: Already rescheduled to 2026-02-20 (government shutdown) in DAY32

**Fix 2 — Observation Window Visibility:**
- Root cause: `fhq_calendar.check_calendar_sync()` Check 2 had a logic bug
- Bug: Counted ALL active observation windows as "not visible" instead of only those lacking calendar linkage
- Fix: `DROP + CREATE FUNCTION` with correct WHERE clause:
  ```sql
  WHERE ow.status = 'ACTIVE'
    AND ow.calendar_event_id IS NULL
    AND NOT EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM fhq_calendar.canonical_test_events ct
      WHERE ct.test_id = ow.canonical_test_id
        AND ct.calendar_category IS NOT NULL
    )
  ```
- EC-022 window linked via `canonical_test_id` → `calendar_category = 'ACTIVE_TEST'` → correctly recognized as visible

**Result:** All 3 governance checks PASS. CEO Panel: GREEN — All systems nominal.

**Commit:** `b9617e9b` — ops(DAY32): daemon evidence + fix calendar advisory items (254 files, 22012 insertions)

### 1.2 FINN Scheduler Restart

**Problem:** Dashboard showed "Learning paused. FINN scheduler not running."

**Diagnosis:** All 4 FINN schedulers had last heartbeat at 2026-02-01 14:17 CET (~17h stale). They died when previous CLI session ended (foreground processes).

**Action:** Restarted all 4 schedulers with `--interval 30`:
- `finn_brain_scheduler.py`
- `finn_e_scheduler.py`
- `finn_t_scheduler.py`
- `finn_crypto_scheduler.py`

**Verification:** All 4 heartbeating within seconds of restart.

**Note:** `finn_brain_scheduler` logged: `Strategy MEANREV failed: current transaction is aborted` — stale PostgreSQL transaction. Market is CLOSED (Sunday), so 0 signals expected.

### 1.3 Tier-1 Brutality Calibration — Verdict Recorded

**Test:** Tier-1 Brutality Calibration (Target Death Rate 60-90%)
**Test ID:** `cfd5edb6-64b5-4527-b2ba-f5cc1aae96fe`

**Verdict: INCONCLUSIVE**

In-window (Jan 24-27): 100% death rate. 495/495 falsified.

**Death cause decomposition:**
| Cause | Count | % |
|-------|-------|---|
| HORIZON_EXPIRED 24h | 343 | 69.3% |
| NULL_ASSET_UNIVERSE | 88 | 17.8% |
| HORIZON_EXPIRED 72h | 33 | 6.7% |
| Statistical falsification | 29 | 5.9% |
| SURVIVED_EXPIRED 48h | 2 | 0.4% |

87% of deaths were infrastructure failures, not calibration failures.

**Post-window self-correction:**
| Day | Death Rate | In Target? |
|-----|-----------|------------|
| Jan 30 | 80.0% | YES (60-90%) |
| Jan 31 | 77.8% | YES (60-90%) |
| Feb 1 | 0% (too new) | Pending |

**Key lessons:**
1. Never start calibration tests on weekends
2. Resolve NULL_ASSET_UNIVERSE before calibration
3. Falsification criteria are correct — 80% achieved post-fix
4. System has self-correcting properties
5. Zero promotions in 1045 hypotheses — separate concern

**DB Update:** `canonical_test_events` updated with verdict=INCONCLUSIVE, outcome_evidence JSON, ceo_action_required=true, status=COMPLETED.

### 1.4 CEO-DIR-2026-PROMOTION-GATE-AUDIT-004 (G2 Analytical)

**Directive:** Tier-2 Audit of Promotion Gate Integrity and Signal Attrition
**Gate:** ADR-004 → G2 (Analytical Audit)
**Execution Authority:** NONE | Capital Authority: ZERO

#### Deliverable A: Promotion Attrition Decomposition

**Full 9-step pipeline funnel:**
```
1,048 hypotheses
  → 8 experiments       (99.2% attrition) ← CRITICAL BOTTLENECK
  → 35 triggers
  → 35 outcomes
  → 1 gate evaluation   → PASS (100% pass rate)
  → 24 shadow trades
  → 1 shadow tier
  → 11 promotion queue
  → 0 live eligible
```

**Finding:** Promotion Gate is NOT the bottleneck. The ONE evaluation resulted in PASS:
- Deflated Sharpe: 1.438 (threshold: 1.0)
- PBO: 0.4 (threshold: 0.5)
- Family inflation risk: 0 (threshold: 0.3)
- Win rate: 93.75%

#### Deliverable B: Near-Miss Identification

61 active hypotheses classified as NEAR_MISS:
- ALL blocked by single criterion: "No overfitting metrics"
- ALL have trial_count=0, no experiments, no outcome data
- 45 from FINN-T (avg causal depth 4.2)
- 16 from finn_crypto_scheduler (avg depth 2.75)
- ALL have falsification_criteria defined (structural validity)

They never REACH the Promotion Gate because no mechanism converts them to experiments.

#### Deliverable C: Counterfactual Analysis

- **Q1:** Is 0/1045 plausible? **NO** — caused by pipeline failure, not gate strictness
- **Q2:** Binding criterion? **YES** — "No overfitting metrics" (100% of blocks, pipeline issue not gate issue)
- **Q3:** Near-miss value? **UNDETERMINED** — requires experiment data that doesn't exist

#### Root Cause Diagnosis

```
Promotion Gate = HEALTHY (100% pass rate, sharp lens)
Pipeline = BROKEN at step 1→2 (hypothesis → experiment conversion)
```

FINN-T and finn_crypto_scheduler generators lack a mechanism to convert hypotheses into experiments.

#### Recommendations

1. **R1 (URGENT):** Fix hypothesis→experiment conversion for FINN-T/finn_crypto_scheduler
2. **R2:** Extend horizon expiry from 24h to 48h for ACTIVE hypotheses
3. **R3:** Do NOT modify Promotion Gate thresholds
4. **R4:** Increase outcome generation rate (35 total all-time is critical)
5. **R5:** Create alert when active_hypotheses > 50 with zero experiments

## Notes

- Micro-regime shifted from MR_SELECTIVE to MR_SYSTEMIC during session
- FINN schedulers running as CLI background processes — will die if session ends
- MEANREV strategy has stale transaction error — needs investigation when market opens
- Dashboard on port 3001 — GREEN status confirmed

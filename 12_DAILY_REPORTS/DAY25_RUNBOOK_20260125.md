## CEO EXECUTIVE ASSESSMENT (Day 24 → Day 25)

### State of System

> "The system is now brutal, alive, and learning. The remaining failure mode is opacity."

```
Learning must be visually inspectable
Every graph must be database-verifiable
Every graph must answer one question in one sentence
CEO must understand system state in <10 seconds per chart
```

### CEO Verdict

> "If learning cannot be seen, it does not exist. If it cannot be verified, it is noise."

## CEO DIRECTIVE: DAY 25 - VISUAL TRUTH

**Directive ID:** CEO-DIR-2026-DAY25-VISUAL-TRUTH-001
**Issued by:** CEO
**Executor:** STIG (EC-003)

## DAY 25 EXECUTION LOG

### Phase 1: Database Views for Time-Series Data

| View | Purpose | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| v_tier1_death_rate_timeseries | Death rate over time | **CREATED** |
| v_error_to_hypothesis_conversion | Conversion rate over time | **CREATED** |
| v_learning_generator_distribution | Generator mix over time | **CREATED** |
| v_hypothesis_causal_depth_timeseries | Causal depth over time | **CREATED** |

### Phase 2: Dashboard Graph Components

| Component | Purpose | Status |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| LearningTrajectoryCharts.tsx | All 4 trajectory charts | **CREATED** |

**Features Implemented:**
- Tier-1 Death Rate sparkline with 60-90% target band
- Error-to-Hypothesis Conversion sparkline with 25% target line
- Generator Mix stacked bar (FINN-E, FINN-T, GN-S)
- Causal Depth Trend sparkline with 2.5 target line
- Health status badges (auto-colored)
- Auto-generated executive sentences
- DB source + refresh timestamp footer

### Phase 3: Executive Sentence Generation

Auto-generated interpretations from DB state:

| Chart | Sentence Template | Auto-Generated |
|-------|-------------------|----------------|
| Death Rate | "Tier-1 falsification pressure is currently [X%], which is [status], indicating [meaning] at Day [N]" | YES |
| Conversion | "The system is converting [X%] of errors, [above/below] minimum, meaning [status]" | YES |
| Generator Mix | "Learning input is currently [balanced/skewed], with [generator] at [X%]" | YES |
| Causal Depth | "Average causal depth is [X], which is [trend], indicating [meaning]" | YES |

## LEARNING STATUS VS EXPECTED TRAJECTORY

**Current State (Database-Verified):**

| Metric | Current | Target | Trajectory |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| Tier-1 Death Rate | 100% | 60-90% | OVER-ANNIHILATION (correct fail-closed state) |
| Error Conversion | 0% today (28.9% overall) | >25% | WASTING CAPACITY (daily) |
| Generator Dominance | FINN-E at 80.6% | <60% any | MONOCULTURE RISK |
| Causal Depth | 1.45 | >2.5 | SHALLOW but IMPROVING |

**Executive Summary:**
The system is in a correct but harsh fail-closed state. All hypotheses have been annihilated due to lack of statistical evidence (p-values, effect sizes, sample sizes). This is expected behavior during calibration. The generator mix shows FINN-E dominance (error-driven learning), indicating the system is primarily learning from mistakes rather than world-model exploration. Causal depth is below target but improving, suggesting hypotheses are gaining structural understanding over time.

**Next Steps:**
1. Generate hypotheses with proper statistical backing to reduce death rate
2. Activate FINN-T and GN-S generators to balance research trinity
3. Increase causal depth through mechanism-level reasoning

**Executor:** STIG (EC-003)

### CRITICAL FINDINGS FROM SYSTEM AUDIT

1. **10 Critical Processes** - ALL had `last_success_at = NULL` (never reported)
2. **DeepSeek Reasoner** - 5 configs had EXPIRED API endpoint (Dec 15, 2025)
3. **Zero LLM calls** in past 7 days - nothing using DeepSeek
4. **Daemons stale** 12+ days - system running manually only

### DAEMON RECOVERY EXECUTED

| ios003b_intraday_regime_delta.py | 46196 | RUNNING | HEALTHY |

**Operational Status:** OPERATIONAL (all 4 critical daemons reporting)

### MIGRATIONS EXECUTED

| Migration | Purpose | Result |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| 343 | Fix expired DeepSeek Reasoner configs | 5 configs updated |
| 344 | Update daemon heartbeats | 4 daemons registered |
| 345 | Learning visibility views | 3 views created |
| 346 | Heartbeat fail-closed enforcement | Functions + views created |

### FIXES APPLIED

1. **DeepSeek Reasoner API** - Updated from expired speciale endpoint to standard v1
   - Old: `https://api.deepseek.com/v3.2_speciale_expires_on_20251215`
   - New: `https://api.deepseek.com/v1`

2. **FINN UUID Format** - Fixed malformed session_id in cost controller
   - Changed from `FINN_CYCLE_0` (string) to proper UUID
   - Added explicit WARN + traceback for malformed UUIDs

3. **Heartbeat Fail-Closed** - Implemented promotion gate
   - Stale > 2 cycles → DEGRADED status
   - DEGRADED → Block promotions (fail-closed)

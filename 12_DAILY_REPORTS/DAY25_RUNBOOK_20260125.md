## CEO EXECUTIVE ASSESSMENT (Day 24 → Day 25)

### State of System

> "The system is now brutal, alive, and learning. The remaining failure mode is opacity."

```
Learning must be visually inspectable
Every graph must be database-verifiable
Every graph must answer one question in one sentence
CEO must understand system state in <10 seconds per chart
```

### CEO Verdict

> "If learning cannot be seen, it does not exist. If it cannot be verified, it is noise."

## DAY 25 EXECUTION LOG

### Phase 1: Database Views for Time-Series Data

| View | Purpose | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| v_tier1_death_rate_timeseries | Death rate over time | **CREATED** |
| v_error_to_hypothesis_conversion | Conversion rate over time | **CREATED** |
| v_learning_generator_distribution | Generator mix over time | **CREATED** |
| v_hypothesis_causal_depth_timeseries | Causal depth over time | **CREATED** |

### Phase 2: Dashboard Graph Components

| Component | Purpose | Status |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| LearningTrajectoryCharts.tsx | All 4 trajectory charts | **CREATED** |

**Features Implemented:**
- Tier-1 Death Rate sparkline with 60-90% target band
- Error-to-Hypothesis Conversion sparkline with 25% target line
- Generator Mix stacked bar (FINN-E, FINN-T, GN-S)

Auto-generated interpretations from DB state:

| Chart | Sentence Template | Auto-Generated |
|-------|-------------------|----------------|
| Death Rate | "Tier-1 falsification pressure is currently [X%], which is [status], indicating [meaning] at Day [N]" | YES |
| Conversion | "The system is converting [X%] of errors, [above/below] minimum, meaning [status]" | YES |
| Generator Mix | "Learning input is currently [balanced/skewed], with [generator] at [X%]" | YES |
| Causal Depth | "Average causal depth is [X], which is [trend], indicating [meaning]" | YES |

## LEARNING STATUS VS EXPECTED TRAJECTORY

**Current State (Database-Verified):**

| Metric | Current | Target | Trajectory |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| Tier-1 Death Rate | 100% | 60-90% | OVER-ANNIHILATION (correct fail-closed state) |
| Error Conversion | 0% today (28.9% overall) | >25% | WASTING CAPACITY (daily) |
| Generator Dominance | FINN-E at 80.6% | <60% any | MONOCULTURE RISK |
| Causal Depth | 1.45 | >2.5 | SHALLOW but IMPROVING |

**Executive Summary:**
The system is in a correct but harsh fail-closed state. All hypotheses have been annihilated due to lack of statistical evidence (p-values, effect sizes, sample sizes). This is expected behavior during calibration. The generator mix shows FINN-E dominance (error-driven learning), indicating the system is primarily learning from mistakes rather than world-model exploration. Causal depth is below target but improving, suggesting hypotheses are gaining structural understanding over time.

**Next Steps:**
1. Generate hypotheses with proper statistical backing to reduce death rate
2. Activate FINN-T and GN-S generators to balance research trinity
3. Increase causal depth through mechanism-level reasoning

## CEO-DIR-2026-CRYPTO-LEARNING-ACTIVATION Session 4: Weekend Blindness Elimination

**Session Start:** 2026-01-25 11:30 CET
**Executor:** STIG (EC-003)
**Directives:** CEO-DIR-2026-CRYPTO-LEARNING-ACTIVATION-001, 002

### Problem Statement

> "Weekend Blindness" - System stopped learning during weekends because FINN scheduler was tied to equity market session state. Crypto markets are 24/7 but no learning was occurring.

**Root Cause:** FINN scheduler checked global `session=CLOSED` which is equity-centric, ignoring that crypto data flows continuously.

### PHASE 1-2: MIC-Aware Infrastructure (Migration 347)

| Component | Change | Status |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| `fhq_meta.exchanges` | Added is_continuous, trading_days columns | **COMPLETE** |
| `fn_is_market_open(mic)` | MIC-aware market session detection | **COMPLETE** |
| `fn_get_learnable_asset_classes()` | Returns currently learnable asset classes | **COMPLETE** |
| `context_injection_layer.py` | Modified to use MIC-aware scheduling | **COMPLETE** |

**MIC Configuration Verified:**

```
XCRYPTO: OPEN (24/7) ✅
BINANCE: OPEN (24/7) ✅
XNYS:    CLOSED (Saturday) ✅
XFOREX:  CLOSED (Weekend) ✅
```

**Learnability Flags:**

```
CRYPTO:    is_learnable = TRUE ✅
US_EQUITY: is_learnable = FALSE ✅
FOREX:     is_learnable = FALSE ✅
```

### PHASE 3-6: Continuous Crypto Learning Pipeline (Migration 348)

| Phase | Description | Status |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| 3 | FINN-T Crypto Theory Activation | **ACTIVATED** |
| 4 | Error → Hypothesis Conversion (>25%) | **ACTIVATED** |
| 5 | GN-S Crypto Shadow Tier | **ACTIVATED** |
| 6 | Binance → IoS-007 Alpha Graph | **ACTIVATED** |

### Phase 3: FINN-T Crypto Theory Artifacts

4 theory types created in `fhq_learning.crypto_theory_artifacts`:

| Theory Type | Description | Causal Depth |
|-------------|-------------|--------------|
| REGIME_TRANSITION | BTC Regime Shift Detection | 3 |
| VOLATILITY_CLUSTERING | Crypto Volatility Clustering | 3 |
| FUNDING_DYNAMICS | Perpetual Funding Rate Asymmetry | 3 |
| LIQUIDATION_CASCADE | Liquidation Cascade Detection | 3 |

### Phase 4: Error → Hypothesis Conversion

- Table: `fhq_learning.error_hypothesis_conversions`
- Function: `fn_convert_error_to_hypothesis()`
- View: `v_error_hypothesis_conversion_rate`
- Target: >25% conversion rate

### Phase 5: GN-S Crypto Shadow Tier

Table: `fhq_learning.crypto_shadow_tier`

**Constraints (Non-Negotiable):**
```
reward_coupling = FALSE
execution_eligibility = FALSE
decision_rights = FALSE
```

### Phase 6: IoS-007 Alpha Graph Integration

8 Binance learning nodes created in `fhq_research.ios007_crypto_learning_nodes`:

| Node Type | Symbols | Mode |
|-----------|---------|------|
| SPOT_PRICE | BTC-USD, ETH-USD | Learning Only |
| PERP_PRICE | BTCUSDT, ETHUSDT | Learning Only |
| FUNDING_RATE | BTCUSDT, ETHUSDT | Learning Only |
| OPEN_INTEREST | BTCUSDT, ETHUSDT | Learning Only |

**Constraints:**
```
learning_only = TRUE
allocation_allowed = FALSE
execution_allowed = FALSE
```

### Appendix A: Strategic Hardening

**Tier-1 Brutality Criteria Added:**

| Criterion | Threshold | Weight |
|-----------|-----------|--------|
| CRYPTO_SIGN_STABILITY | 80% | 2.50 |
| CRYPTO_STATISTICAL_P001 | p<0.01 | 2.50 |
| CRYPTO_CAUSAL_DEPTH_25 | ≥2.5 | 2.00 |
| CRYPTO_DEATH_RATE_TARGET | 60-90% | 3.00 |

**Fail-Closed Rule:**
> If death_rate < 60% for 24h → LEARNING_MODE = PAUSED

### Daemon Health Verification (Section 1.1)

| Daemon | Status | Staleness |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| price_freshness_heartbeat | HEALTHY | 65s |
| cnrp_orchestrator | HEALTHY | 9s |

**Acceptance Test:** `healthy_daemons = 2/2` ✅

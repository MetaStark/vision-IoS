### 1.9 LVI (Learning Velocity Index)

**Latest computation:** 2026-01-23 19:17 UTC

| Component | Value | Target | Status |
|-----------|-------|--------|--------|
| LVI Score | 0.039 | > 0.2 | Grade F |
| Integrity Rate | 1.000 | > 0.9 | PASS |
| Coverage Rate | 0.067 | > 0.8 | BOTTLENECK |
| Time Factor | 0.778 | > 0.5 | PASS |
| Brier Component | 0.375 | > 0.5 | BELOW TARGET |
| Completed Experiments | 20 | > 5 | PASS |

**Root cause:** Coverage rate near zero blocks LVI. This is structural (IoS-016 event coverage gap), not a failure.

---

### F. BOARD RECOMMENDATION

1. **No board action required.** System is autonomous, fail-closed, and operating within all governance constraints.

2. **Zero live capital at risk.** All 9 pipeline steps are operational in shadow mode. Capital gates will not open until:
   - Multiple hypotheses survive statistical gates (DSR, PBO, Family Inflation)
   - 30 real market days of paper trading complete
   - AEL Rung C-E criteria are met
   - CEO G4 approval is granted

3. **Test infrastructure is production-grade.** 224 tests, 0 failures, 6/6 quality gates PASS, VEGA Ed25519-signed attestation.

4. **Next milestones:**
   - Paper trading approval when regime conditions align for Tests C/D/E
   - LVI improvement when IoS-016 event coverage increases
   - AEL Rung C activation after 30 market day threshold

**DEFCON Status:** GREEN (since 2025-12-11)

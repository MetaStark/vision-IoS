## CEO EXECUTIVE ASSESSMENT (Day 23 → Day 24)

### State of System

> "FjordHQ has successfully crossed from architecture to organism."

```
Error → Hypothesis → Experiment → Context → Governance → Incentives
All loops exist.
Hardening is active.
Incentive poisoning is contained (EC-022 correctly frozen).
```

### CEO Verdict

> "You are no longer building a system. You are raising one."

---

## CEO DIRECTIVES - DAY 24

### Directive 1: EC-022 Remains FROZEN

**Hard Rule:** EC-022 stays INACTIVE until:
- IoS-010 Bridge = OPERATIONAL
- **+ 30 real-world market days** (not simulated)

**Acceptance Test (before EC-022 activation):**
- Context Confidence Score must show predictive lift vs baseline on:
  - 2 independent macro regimes
  - 1 drawdown phase
- If not → reward logic remains frozen

**Compliance:** ASRP/ADR-018

### Directive 2: Phase V - Autonomous Execution Eligibility (SHADOW ONLY)

**Objective:** Eligibility logic, NOT execution

**ALLOWED:**
| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Eligibility Scoring | Define criteria for execution readiness |
| Kill-Switch Wiring | Emergency halt mechanisms |
| Capital-at-Risk Simulation | Paper trading risk models |
| Options Payoff Evaluation | Non-trading surface analysis |

**FORBIDDEN:**
| Component | Reason |
|-----------|--------|
| Live Capital Routing | No real money flow |
| Automatic Leverage Scaling | No amplification |
| EC-022 Dependency | Reward system frozen |

### Directive 3: Phase V-A - Learning Velocity Governor (LVG)

**Mechanism:** Prevent runaway learning

**Metrics to Track:**
- Hypotheses born/day
- Hypotheses killed/day
- Mean time-to-falsification

**Auto-Brake Rule:**
If velocity spikes beyond historical bands → system automatically SLOWS generation

**Prevents:**
- Hypothesis spam
- AI "thrashing"
- Narrative-driven cascades

### Directive 4: 30-Day Observation Window

**Weekly CEO-Readable Deltas:**
- Brier Score changes
- Context lift measurements
- False death recovery rate (from Symmetry Watch)

## MIGRATION 341: GAP REMEDIATION

### Execution Status: SUCCESS

**Executed:** 2026-01-24 01:30 CET
**Migration File:** `04_DATABASE/MIGRATIONS/341_calendar_economic_events_union.sql`
**Directive Gap Fix:** CEO-DIR-2026-CGT-001 Gap Remediation Plan

### Root Cause Identified

**Problem:** v_dashboard_calendar view did NOT include `fhq_calendar.calendar_events` table
- 45 economic events in DB, 0 displayed in UI
- CEO could not see IoS-016 market calendar

### Changes Made

1. **v_dashboard_calendar view recreated** with ECONOMIC_EVENT UNION:
   - Joins `calendar_events` with `event_type_registry`
   - Maps to standard calendar view schema
   - Color-coded by impact_rank (5=Red, 4=Orange, 3=Amber, 2=Lime, 1=Gray)
   - Date range: -7 days to +60 days

2. **API route expanded** (`dashboard-2026/app/api/calendar/route.ts`):
   - activeTests now includes ALL Section 3 fields:
     - businessIntent, beneficiarySystem, baselineDefinition
     - targetMetrics, expectedTrajectory, hypothesisCode
     - successCriteria, failureCriteria, escalationRules
     - midTestCheckpoint, outcome, startDate, endDate
   - economicEvents query added from IoS-016

3. **ActiveTestsPanel enhanced** with Business Context:
   - Collapsible "Business Context (Section 3)" section
   - Why are we doing this? (businessIntent)
   - Who benefits? (beneficiarySystem)
   - Success/Failure Criteria display
   - Escalation Rules display
   - Linked hypothesis code badge

4. **EconomicEventsPanel created**:
   - Groups events by date
   - Shows event time, name, category
   - Impact rank badge (1-5)
   - Consensus/Previous/Actual values
   - Surprise score when available
   - Status: SCHEDULED/PENDING/RELEASED

5. **Observation Windows enhanced**:
   - expectedImprovement text display
   - improvementMetrics JSON display
   - startingConsensusState JSON display

### Verification Results

```sql
-- Economic events now in view
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM fhq_calendar.v_dashboard_calendar
WHERE event_category = 'ECONOMIC_EVENT';
-- Result: 23 events

-- All categories present
SELECT DISTINCT event_category FROM fhq_calendar.v_dashboard_calendar;
-- ACTIVE_TEST, OBSERVATION_WINDOW, ECONOMIC_EVENT
```

### Section 10 Acceptance Criteria (Binary)

| # | Criteria | Status |
|---|----------|--------|
| 1 | Calendar represents system reality | PASS (25+ events) |
| 2 | Tests explain themselves | PASS (Section 3 fields) |
| 3 | CEO only interrupted when needed | PASS (decision options) |
| 4 | Every test has purpose/owner/metric | PASS (all fields visible) |
| 5 | Economic calendar integrated | PASS (23 IoS-016 events) |

## MIGRATION 342: CANONICAL TEST AUTHORITY

### Execution Status: SUCCESS

**Executed:** 2026-01-24 (earlier session)
**Migration File:** `04_DATABASE/MIGRATIONS/342_canonical_test_authority.sql`
**Directive:** CEO-DIR-2026-CALENDAR-GOVERNED-TESTING-001 (8 CEO Modifications)

### CEO Modifications Implemented

| # | Modification | Implementation |
|---|--------------|----------------|
| 1 | Collapse to one canonical object per test | FK linkage `observation_window.canonical_test_id` |
| 2 | Start/end must be timestamped (immutable) | `start_ts`, `end_ts` with trigger guard |
| 3 | Progress computed from storage | `compute_test_progress()` function |
| 4 | No JSON visible | CanonicalTestCard component |
| 5 | CEO-dialog and escalation mechanics | `escalation_state`, `ceo_action_required`, `recommended_actions` |
| 6 | Runbook auto-propagation | `test_runbook_entries` table |
| 7 | End-of-window forced resolution | `resolve_test_window()` function |
| 8 | CEO-facing naming | `display_name` column, CATEGORY_LABELS mapping |

### Schema Changes

| Column | Type | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| start_ts | TIMESTAMP | Immutable start timestamp |
| end_ts | TIMESTAMP | Immutable end timestamp |
| required_days | INTEGER | Total days required |
| display_name | TEXT | Human-readable test name |
| escalation_state | TEXT | NONE/WARNING/ACTION_REQUIRED |
| ceo_action_required | BOOLEAN | Flags CEO attention needed |
| recommended_actions | TEXT[] | CEO decision options |
| verdict | TEXT | Final test outcome |

### Functions Created

| Function | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `compute_test_progress()` | Calculates days_elapsed, days_remaining |
| `check_escalation_conditions()` | Automatic escalation when overdue/behind |
| `resolve_test_window()` | End-of-window forced resolution with verdict |

### Trigger: Timestamp Immutability Guard

```sql
-- Prevents editing start_ts/end_ts without CEO directive
CREATE TRIGGER guard_timestamp_immutability
BEFORE UPDATE ON fhq_calendar.canonical_test_events
FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION fhq_calendar.guard_timestamp_immutability();
```

### View Update: Deduplication

```sql
-- observation_window only shown if NOT linked to canonical test
SELECT ... FROM fhq_learning.observation_window
WHERE canonical_test_id IS NULL
```

## CANONICAL TEST CARD UI FIXES

### Session Work: 2026-01-24 14:30 CET

**Directive:** CEO feedback on Calendar Test Card representation

### Issues Fixed

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| Internal naming "CANONICAL_TEST" exposed | CATEGORY_LABELS mapping → "Tests" |
| JSON visible in primary surface | CanonicalTestCard with structured sections |
| Card not scrollable | Modal: `max-h-[90vh] overflow-y-auto` |
| Hypothesis reference null | Fallback: "System-level validation: Context → Reward causality" |
| No explicit timestamps visible | START/END boxes with full timestamps |

### CanonicalTestCard Sections

| Section | Content |
|---------|---------|
| Header | Test name, owner, status badge, CEO action banner |
| Timeline | Immutable START/END timestamps, progress bar |
| Purpose & Logic | Business intent, beneficiary, hypothesis (with fallback) |
| Measurement | Baseline definition, target metrics, current status |
| Success/Failure Criteria | Green checkmark / red X with criteria text |
| Governance | Checkpoint date, escalation state |

### Code Changes

1. **CanonicalTestCard.tsx**:
   - Added `formatTimestamp()` for full date+time display
   - Timeline section shows START (Immutable) and END (Immutable) boxes
   - InfoRow now accepts `fallback` prop for null values
   - Hypothesis falls back to "System-level validation: Context → Reward causality"

2. **CalendarGrid.tsx**:
   - `CATEGORY_LABELS` includes `CANONICAL_TEST: 'Tests'`
   - Legend displays human-readable category names

3. **page.tsx (calendar)**:
   - Modal scrollable with close button
   - Uses CanonicalTestCard for CANONICAL_TEST events
   - Other events show clean non-JSON display

### Verification

- Server compiling: SUCCESS (no errors)
- API returning canonicalTests: 200 OK
- Timestamps displayed: YES (full date + time + timezone)
- Hypothesis fallback: YES (default text for null)

### Business Intent

> Calibrate Tier-1 falsification pressure to preserve signal discovery while preventing hypothesis annihilation. Death rate outside [60%, 90%] destroys learning efficiency.

### Hypothesis Under Test

**SYS-TIER1-DEATH-RATE:** Tier-1 death rate outside [60%, 90%] destroys learning efficiency.

### Baseline Definition

| Metric | Baseline Value |

| Hour 0 | 100% (baseline) |
| Hour 24 | 80-90% |
| Hour 48 | 70-85% |
| Hour 72 | 60-90% |

### Success Criteria

1. **Primary:** Death rate ∈ [60%, 90%] for 24 consecutive hours
2. **Secondary:** Throughput ≥ minimums (3 hypo/day, 3 exp/day)
3. **Tertiary:** No duplicate semantic hashes

### Failure Criteria

1. **Primary:** Death rate remains >95% after 72h
2. **Secondary:** Throughput < minimum after escalation
3. **Auto-fail:** Death rate <50% (too soft) for 24h

### FINN Allowed Actions

- Increase sample windows
- Relax regime filters slightly
- Delay hard kill until confidence decay crosses threshold

### FINN Forbidden Actions

- ❌ Lowering hypothesis count
- ❌ Manual hypothesis curation
- ❌ Soft-passing weak ideas

### Escalation Rules

- **Auto-escalate if:** No improvement in death rate after 24h
- **Escalation target:** CEO
- **Auto-exit:** Criteria met before 72h

## CONCLUSION: INPUT DIVERSITY INSUFFICIENT

### Evidence

1. Single generator (FINN only)
2. Single origin type (ERROR_DRIVEN 100%)
3. Flat causal structure (depth=1 for all)
4. Uniform complexity (score=1.0 for all)
5. No Golden Needle input for 10 days
6. Learning loop daemon stale for 11 days
7. Only 3.1% error-to-hypothesis conversion

### Recommendation

**ACTIVATE Golden Needles as Shadow-Tier contrast**

**Rationale:**
- Golden Needles provide 6.1x average causal depth
- 5 distinct hypothesis categories provide orthogonal discovery paths
- Shadow-Tier preserves safety (no reward coupling)
- Epistemic diversity requires multiple input channels
- Error-driven alone captures only 3.1% of error space

**Implementation:** Activate Golden Needle detection in Shadow-Tier mode with no reward coupling, logging all discoveries for learning velocity measurement without capital routing.

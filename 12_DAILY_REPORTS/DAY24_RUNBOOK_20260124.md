## CEO EXECUTIVE ASSESSMENT (Day 23 → Day 24)

### State of System

> "FjordHQ has successfully crossed from architecture to organism."

```
Error → Hypothesis → Experiment → Context → Governance → Incentives
All loops exist.
Hardening is active.
Incentive poisoning is contained (EC-022 correctly frozen).
```

### CEO Verdict

> "You are no longer building a system. You are raising one."

---

## CEO DIRECTIVES - DAY 24

### Directive 1: EC-022 Remains FROZEN

**Hard Rule:** EC-022 stays INACTIVE until:
- IoS-010 Bridge = OPERATIONAL
- **+ 30 real-world market days** (not simulated)

**Acceptance Test (before EC-022 activation):**
- Context Confidence Score must show predictive lift vs baseline on:
  - 2 independent macro regimes
  - 1 drawdown phase
- If not → reward logic remains frozen

**Compliance:** ASRP/ADR-018

### Directive 2: Phase V - Autonomous Execution Eligibility (SHADOW ONLY)

**Objective:** Eligibility logic, NOT execution

**ALLOWED:**
| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Eligibility Scoring | Define criteria for execution readiness |
| Kill-Switch Wiring | Emergency halt mechanisms |
| Capital-at-Risk Simulation | Paper trading risk models |
| Options Payoff Evaluation | Non-trading surface analysis |

**FORBIDDEN:**
| Component | Reason |
|-----------|--------|
| Live Capital Routing | No real money flow |
| Automatic Leverage Scaling | No amplification |
| EC-022 Dependency | Reward system frozen |

### Directive 3: Phase V-A - Learning Velocity Governor (LVG)

**Mechanism:** Prevent runaway learning

**Metrics to Track:**
- Hypotheses born/day
- Hypotheses killed/day
- Mean time-to-falsification

**Auto-Brake Rule:**
If velocity spikes beyond historical bands → system automatically SLOWS generation

**Prevents:**
- Hypothesis spam
- AI "thrashing"
- Narrative-driven cascades

### Directive 4: 30-Day Observation Window

**Weekly CEO-Readable Deltas:**
- Brier Score changes
- Context lift measurements
- False death recovery rate (from Symmetry Watch)

## MIGRATION 341: GAP REMEDIATION

### Execution Status: SUCCESS

**Executed:** 2026-01-24 01:30 CET
**Migration File:** `04_DATABASE/MIGRATIONS/341_calendar_economic_events_union.sql`
**Directive Gap Fix:** CEO-DIR-2026-CGT-001 Gap Remediation Plan

### Root Cause Identified

**Problem:** v_dashboard_calendar view did NOT include `fhq_calendar.calendar_events` table
- 45 economic events in DB, 0 displayed in UI
- CEO could not see IoS-016 market calendar

### Changes Made

1. **v_dashboard_calendar view recreated** with ECONOMIC_EVENT UNION:
   - Joins `calendar_events` with `event_type_registry`
   - Maps to standard calendar view schema
   - Color-coded by impact_rank (5=Red, 4=Orange, 3=Amber, 2=Lime, 1=Gray)
   - Date range: -7 days to +60 days

2. **API route expanded** (`dashboard-2026/app/api/calendar/route.ts`):
   - activeTests now includes ALL Section 3 fields:
     - businessIntent, beneficiarySystem, baselineDefinition
     - targetMetrics, expectedTrajectory, hypothesisCode
     - successCriteria, failureCriteria, escalationRules
     - midTestCheckpoint, outcome, startDate, endDate
   - economicEvents query added from IoS-016

3. **ActiveTestsPanel enhanced** with Business Context:
   - Collapsible "Business Context (Section 3)" section
   - Why are we doing this? (businessIntent)
   - Who benefits? (beneficiarySystem)
   - Success/Failure Criteria display
   - Escalation Rules display
   - Linked hypothesis code badge

4. **EconomicEventsPanel created**:
   - Groups events by date
   - Shows event time, name, category
   - Impact rank badge (1-5)
   - Consensus/Previous/Actual values
   - Surprise score when available
   - Status: SCHEDULED/PENDING/RELEASED

5. **Observation Windows enhanced**:
   - expectedImprovement text display
   - improvementMetrics JSON display
   - startingConsensusState JSON display

### Verification Results

```sql
-- Economic events now in view
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM fhq_calendar.v_dashboard_calendar
WHERE event_category = 'ECONOMIC_EVENT';
-- Result: 23 events

-- All categories present
SELECT DISTINCT event_category FROM fhq_calendar.v_dashboard_calendar;
-- ACTIVE_TEST, OBSERVATION_WINDOW, ECONOMIC_EVENT
```

### Section 10 Acceptance Criteria (Binary)

| # | Criteria | Status |
|---|----------|--------|
| 1 | Calendar represents system reality | PASS (25+ events) |
| 2 | Tests explain themselves | PASS (Section 3 fields) |
| 3 | CEO only interrupted when needed | PASS (decision options) |
| 4 | Every test has purpose/owner/metric | PASS (all fields visible) |
| 5 | Economic calendar integrated | PASS (23 IoS-016 events) |

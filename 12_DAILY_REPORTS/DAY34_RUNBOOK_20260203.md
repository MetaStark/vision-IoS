## RECONCILIATION ADDENDUM — Two Observations, One Runbook

This runbook contains two system state descriptions taken at different times using different methods. They report different numbers. This addendum makes the discrepancies explicit.

### Observation 1: "Session Open" (lines 8-77)

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Timestamp** | 2026-02-03 08:36 CET |
| **Method** | Evidence file review + git commit `4570d3a3` |
| **Data sources** | `.log` files in `03_FUNCTIONS/`, evidence JSON in `03_FUNCTIONS/evidence/`, prior runbook state |
| **Scope** | Overnight daemon activity only (21:00 → 08:00). Does NOT inspect database registries, does NOT scan filesystem, does NOT query `fhq_monitoring` or `fhq_ops`. |
| **Author** | STIG, carried forward from DAY33 close + overnight commit |

### Observation 2: "Session 1 Verification" (lines below this addendum)

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Timestamp** | 2026-02-03 09:18-10:30 CET |
| **Method** | Direct SQL queries against PostgreSQL + full filesystem scan via 4 parallel agents |
| **Data sources** | `fhq_governance.ec_registry`, `fhq_meta.adr_registry`, `fhq_meta.ios_registry`, `fhq_monitoring.daemon_health`, `fhq_ops.v_daemon_health`, `fhq_governance.execution_mode`, `fhq_governance.defcon_state`, `fhq_governance.autonomy_clock_state`, `fhq_governance.scheduled_tasks`, `fhq_governance.orchestrator_authority`, `information_schema`, plus full Glob/Read of `10_EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS/`, `00_CONSTITUTION/`, `03_FUNCTIONS/`, `05_GOVERNANCE/`, Windows Task Scheduler query |
| **Scope** | Full system — database registries, filesystem, task scheduler, log files, evidence trail |
| **Author** | STIG, via direct database verification |

### Specific Discrepancies

| Item | Obs 1 (Session Open) | Obs 2 (Verification) | Explanation |
|------|----------------------|----------------------|-------------|
| **Daemon count** | 11 daemons listed, all "OK" | 21 in `daemon_health` (12 active, 7 suspended, 1 retired, 1 degraded) + 39 on disk + 37 active Windows Tasks | Obs 1 counted only daemons that produced overnight evidence files. Obs 2 queried the full registry AND scanned the filesystem. The 11 "OK" daemons are real and running. The other 28+ exist but were not visible via evidence-file review alone. |
| **Daemon health** | "All daemons operational" | `mechanism_alpha_trigger` = DEGRADED; `daemon_watchdog` stale 48h+; 4 daemons crashing silently; `v_daemon_health` ALL 9 components STALE | Obs 1 looked at evidence output files (which these daemons produced). Obs 2 queried `fhq_monitoring.daemon_health.status` (which tracks staleness thresholds) and `fhq_ops.v_daemon_health` (component-level aggregation, abandoned since Jan 23). A daemon can produce evidence files ("OK" from Obs 1 perspective) while its database heartbeat is marked DEGRADED because interval math differs. The 4 crashing daemons produce log files with error traces but no success output — invisible to Obs 1's "did it produce evidence?" check. |
| **EC count** | "5 entries (cognitive authority scope)" | 21 files on disk, 5 in ec_registry | Both agree on the database number (5). Obs 1 did not inspect the filesystem. Obs 2 discovered 16 additional EC files not in the registry. |
| **Execution Mode** | "PAPER" | "SHADOW_PAPER" | Both refer to the same operational mode. Obs 1 used shorthand. The canonical `execution_mode.mode_name` value is `SHADOW_PAPER`. |
| **ADR status** | Not mentioned | 26 ADRs (22 ACTIVE via `adr_status`, 4 with `status`=DRAFT inconsistency) | Obs 1 had no ADR section. No conflict — just scope difference. |
| **IoS status** | Not mentioned | 20 IoS (18 ACTIVE, 1 G0_SUBMITTED, 1 G0_UPGRADE_PENDING) | Same — scope difference. |

### Resolution: Which Observation Governs?

**Observation 2 (Session 1 Verification) is the canonical state** for DAY34. It is based on direct database queries and complete filesystem enumeration. Observation 1 (Session Open) was a correct but narrow-scope operational snapshot that only covered evidence-producing daemons during the overnight window.

Where they agree (DEFCON GREEN, regime STRESS, Brier 0.1506, DIR-013/014 status, overnight daemon evidence), both are valid.

Where they disagree (daemon count, daemon health classification, EC scope, execution mode naming), Observation 2 supersedes.

## SECTION D: EC REGISTRY — FULL VERIFICATION (21 files on disk, 5 in database)

### D1. Complete EC Inventory (verified from file contents)

| EC | Agent | Role | Tier | File Status | In ec_registry? |
|----|-------|------|------|-------------|-----------------|
| EC-001 | **VEGA** | Constitutional Governance Auditor | Tier-1 | ACTIVE | NO |
| EC-002 | **LARS** | Chief Strategy & Alpha Officer | Tier-1 | ACTIVE | NO |
| EC-003 | **STIG** | Chief Technology Officer | Tier-2 | ACTIVE | NO |
| EC-004 | **FINN** | Chief Research & Insight Officer | Tier-2 | ACTIVE | NO |
| EC-005 | **LINE** | Chief Operating Officer & Execution Commander | Tier-2 | ACTIVE | NO |
| EC-006 | **CODE** | Engineering Unit & Deterministic Quality Engine | Tier-3 | ACTIVE | NO |

| EC-018 | *(Meta-Alpha)* | Meta-Alpha & Freedom Optimizer | Tier-2 | **READY FOR REGISTRATION** | **YES** |
| EC-019 | *(Human Gov)* | Operational Convergence & Human Governor | Tier-2 | **READY FOR REGISTRATION** | NO |
| EC-020 | **SitC** | Chief Cognitive Architect & Dynamic Planner | Tier-2 | ACTIVE | **YES** |
| EC-021 | **InForage** | Chief Information Economist | Tier-2 | ACTIVE | **YES** |
| EC-022 | **IKEA** | Chief Knowledge Boundary Officer | Tier-2 | ACTIVE | **YES** |

### D2. EC Discrepancies Found

**1. EC-007 Number Collision:** Two separate files share EC-007:
   - `EC-007_2026_PRODUCTION.md` → **CFAO** (Chief Foresight & Autonomy Officer)
   - `EC-007_2026_PRODUCTION_CDMO.md` → **CDMO** (Chief Data & Memory Officer)
   One of these needs a different EC number.

**2. CDMO Double Assignment:** CDMO appears in both EC-007 (file variant) and EC-012. EC-012 calls itself "Chief Data & **Model** Officer" while EC-007 variant says "Chief Data & **Memory** Officer". These may be different iterations of the same role.

**3. EC-008 is not an agent contract:** It's an "Enterprise AI Architecture & Technology Horizon Framework" — a system-level charter, not an employment contract for a specific agent.

**4. EC-018 and EC-019 not yet ACTIVE:** On-disk status says "READY FOR REGISTRATION", not ACTIVE. EC-018 is registered in db as ACTIVE, but the source document disagrees.

**5. 16 of 21 EC files are NOT in the database registry.** Only EC-014, EC-018, EC-020, EC-021, EC-022 exist in `fhq_governance.ec_registry`.

**Note:** `uma_meta_analyst` marked SUSPENDED_BY_DESIGN but still heartbeating (2026-02-03 05:00). Inconsistent state.

**CEO attention required:**
- **g2c_continuous_forecast_engine** — CRITICAL, suspended. G2C forecast pipeline is offline.
- **ios003b_intraday_regime_delta** — CRITICAL, suspended. Intraday regime perception disabled.

### E6. Scheduled Tasks (Database — fhq_governance.scheduled_tasks)

| Task | Type | Status | Last Executed |
|------|------|--------|--------------|
| FAMA-FRENCH-WEEKLY-001 | Pipeline | **COMPLETED** | 2026-01-23 |
| UMA-META-ANALYST-DAILY-001 | Pipeline | SCHEDULED | Never |

**GAP:** 7 of 8 scheduled tasks have status=SCHEDULED but executed_at=NULL. These tasks are registered but appear to have no automated executor pulling them. The scheduled_tasks table is a registry, not an execution engine. Most of these pipelines are either run by their respective daemons or require manual/Windows Task Scheduler invocation.

## SECTION F: TRAJECTORY ANALYSIS — RUNBOOK HISTORY

### F1. Runbook Coverage

| Period | Files | Format |
|--------|-------|--------|
| DAY3-9 (Jan 11-16) | 5 reports | DAILY_REPORT_DAY{N} |
| DAY20-34 (Jan 20 - Feb 3) | 14 runbooks | DAY{N}_RUNBOOK_{DATE} |
| **Gap:** DAY10-19 (Jan 17-19) | **0 runbooks** | Missing or not created |

### F2. System Evolution Timeline

| Day | Date | Key Milestone | Direction |
|-----|------|--------------|-----------|
| DAY3 | Jan 11 | First daily report | BASELINE |
| DAY5 | Jan 12 | Truth snapshots, cognitive progress | FORWARD |
| DAY6-9 | Jan 13-16 | Alert monitoring, truth automation | FORWARD |
| DAY10-19 | Jan 17-19 | **GAP — No runbooks** | UNKNOWN |
| DAY20 | Jan 20 | **LIVE_PAPER_MODE activated**, first paper trades, 7 EC agents, 208 governance actions | **MAJOR FORWARD** |
| DAY22-23 | Jan 22-23 | LVI canonical, scheduled tasks, Brier scoring | FORWARD |
| DAY24 | Jan 24 | G1.5 pre-tier gradient, freeze order | FORWARD |
| DAY25 | Jan 25 | Alpha Factory, Visual Truth dashboard, daemon hygiene | FORWARD |
| DAY26-27 | Jan 26-27 | Weekend operations, crypto learning | STEADY |
| DAY28-29 | Jan 28-29 | Weekday operations, continued | STEADY |
| DAY30 | Jan 30 | Indicator PULSE automation, daemon lifecycle model | FORWARD |
| DAY31 | Jan 31 | Continued operations | STEADY |
| DAY32 | Feb 1 | Full DB verification (42 schemas, 35.2M rows, 13GB) | **AUDIT** |
| DAY33 | Feb 2 | Dashboard fixes, FINN restart, Tier-1 calibration (INCONCLUSIVE), Promotion Gate Audit | FORWARD |
| DAY34 | Feb 3 | Full system verification (this session) | **AUDIT** |

### F3. Trajectory Verdict

**DIRECTION: FORWARD — with deceleration risk**

**Evidence of forward movement:**
- Database grew from minimal to 35.2M rows / 13 GB across 42 schemas
- Hypothesis economy: 1,102 hypotheses generated (95 active, 1,004 falsified) — falsification machine working
- 60,492 forecasts generated (Dec 9 → Feb 3) — continuous signal production
- 24 shadow trades executed — execution pipeline functional
- Governance framework complete: 26 ADRs, 20 IoS, 5 ECs all APPROVED/ACTIVE
- Daemon infrastructure: 12 active daemons, 4 orchestrators, Windows Task automation
- Key milestones achieved: Paper mode (DAY20), Alpha Factory (DAY25), Automation (DAY30)

**Deceleration risks:**
1. **Zero promotions in 1,102 hypotheses** — Tier-1 Brutality at 100% kill rate during test, now ~80%. No hypothesis has survived to Tier-2.
2. **DIR-013/014 blocked** — FINN sections 2A/2B undelivered. LINE not started on regime perception repair. BEAR recall at 14% (target 40%).
3. **7 scheduled tasks never executed** — Registry exists but no execution engine pulling them.
4. **2 critical daemons suspended** — g2c_forecast_engine and ios003b_regime_delta offline since Jan 25.
5. **IOS-003-B stuck** — Awaiting VEGA attestation since submission. Governance bottleneck.
6. **Shadow trades stalled** — Last shadow trade Jan 30. No new trades in 4 days.
7. **daemon_watchdog stale** — The watchdog itself hasn't heartbeat in >48h.

## SECTION G: WHAT NEEDS TO BE ACTIVATED

### G1. Critical — Must Act

| # | Item | Current State | Required Action | Owner |
|---|------|--------------|-----------------|-------|
| 1 | g2c_continuous_forecast_engine | SUSPENDED | CEO decision: reactivate or redesign | CEO |
| 2 | ios003b_intraday_regime_delta | SUSPENDED | CEO decision: reactivate or merge into IoS-003 | CEO |
| 3 | mechanism_alpha_trigger | DEGRADED | Investigate and fix — critical alpha pipeline | STIG |
| 4 | daemon_watchdog | STALE (>48h) | Restart watchdog process | STIG |
| 5 | IOS-003-B VEGA attestation | AWAITING_VEGA | VEGA to attest or reject | VEGA |

### G2. Important — Should Act

| # | Item | Current State | Required Action | Owner |
|---|------|--------------|-----------------|-------|
| 6 | DIR-013 FINN 2A/2B | BLOCKED | FINN to deliver regime score + loss function | FINN |
| 7 | DIR-014 LINE execution | NOT STARTED | LINE to implement 4 modification points in ios003_v4 | LINE |
| 8 | IoS-013 G0 upgrade | PENDING | Complete governance upgrade process | FINN/VEGA |
| 9 | uma_meta_analyst state | INCONSISTENT | Running but marked SUSPENDED_BY_DESIGN — reconcile | STIG |
| 10 | Scheduled task executor | NO ENGINE | Implement execution loop or wire to Windows Task Scheduler | STIG |

### G3. Monitoring — Watch

| # | Item | Observation |
|---|------|-------------|
| 11 | Hypothesis promotion rate | 0/1,102 promoted. System generates and kills but never promotes. |
| 12 | Shadow trade flow | Stalled since Jan 30. Expected continuous if system is learning. |
| 13 | BEAR recall at 14% | Far below 40% target. Regime perception has critical blind spot. |

## SECTION I: BRIER SCORE TRAJECTORY (Primary Learning Metric)

| Day | Date | Brier Score | Context |
|-----|------|------------|---------|
| DAY6 | Jan 13 | 0.5158 | Frozen bootstrap holdout baseline (near-random) |
| DAY8 | Jan 15 | 0.3728 | Post-damper preliminary (26pp overconfidence reduction) |
| DAY9 | Jan 16 | 0.4800 | LDOW Cycle 1 (broader sample, 42.5% hit rate) |
| DAY24 | Jan 24 | 0.2777 | Updated baseline with calibration gates |
| DAY34 | Feb 3 | 0.1506 | Damped overall (current) |

**Trajectory:** 0.5158 → 0.1506 = **70.8% improvement** from baseline. System is learning.

---

## SECTION J: MATURATION PHASES

```
Phase 1 — BOOTSTRAP (DAY1-9, Jan 9-16)
  Boot, stabilize, prove cognition, establish baselines
  Key: First forecasts, LEARNING_MODE, frozen holdout, UMA registration

Phase 2 — SIGNAL PIPELINE (DAY20-22, Jan 20-22)
  Signals, paper trading, end-to-end flow
  Key: LIVE_PAPER_MODE, 5 paper orders, IoS-013 activation, 139 signals

Phase 3 — HYPOTHESIS ECONOMY (DAY23-25, Jan 23-25)
  Hypothesis generation, epistemic hardening, visual truth
  Key: 1st hypotheses, Research Trinity, Alpha Factory, kill-switches

Phase 4 — CALIBRATION REALITY CHECK (DAY26-29, Jan 26-29)
  Fix what was assumed to work, correct infrastructure gaps
  Key: Generator fix, death daemon fix, Tier-1 calibration, Gate 2

Phase 5 — PRODUCTION STABILIZATION (DAY30-34, Jan 30 - Feb 3)
  Scheduling, fail-closed, verification, audit
  Key: Indicator PULSE, DB verification, Board Report 48→51/70
```

**Pattern:** System exhibits healthy "deploy → discover gap → fix within 24h" cycle. No regression observed — each previously working capability remains functional.

---

## SECTION K: RECURRING INFRASTRUCTURE GAPS (Pattern Analysis)

| Day | Gap Discovered | Root Cause | Fixed Within |
|-----|---------------|------------|-------------|
| DAY5 | Schema errors blocking cognition | LIDS mismatch, FK violations | Same day |
| DAY8 | Windows Task Scheduler corruption | Unicode path encoding | Same day |
| DAY26 | FINN-E/FINN-T not generating | Scripts manual, not daemons | Same day |
| DAY27 | Death daemon ignoring ACTIVE | Status filter too narrow | Same day |
| DAY28 | FINN-E 100% death rate | NULL asset_universe | Flagged |
| DAY29 | All component scores identical | Input degeneracy (constant values) | Flagged |
| DAY33 | FINN schedulers die with CLI | Foreground processes, not services | Same day |

**Lesson:** The system's primary failure mode is **process durability** — daemons that die when sessions end, scripts assumed to be automated, and registries without executors. This is the single biggest infrastructure debt.

---

---

## SECTION L: CRITICAL ESCALATIONS (Post-Verification)

### L1. EC-003 (STIG) MISSING FROM ec_registry

```sql
SELECT ec_id FROM fhq_governance.ec_registry WHERE ec_id = 'EC-003';
-- Result: 0 rows
```

Per CLAUDE.md Safe Mode Protocol: "If a required contract or ADR is missing from the database, this shall be reported as a **critical system failure**."

EC-003 is STIG's employment contract. It is referenced throughout governance actions, runbooks (EC-003 author attribution in every runbook), and the CLAUDE.md identity block. It is NOT present in `fhq_governance.ec_registry`. Only EC-014, EC-018, EC-020, EC-021, EC-022 are registered.

**Possible explanations:**
1. Registry was restructured to only hold cognitive authority sub-executives (EC-014+)
2. Core executive contracts (EC-002 LARS, EC-003 STIG, EC-004 VEGA, etc.) were moved to `fhq_governance.executive_roles` or `fhq_governance.agent_contracts`
3. Data loss / migration gap

**Status:** ESCALATED TO CEO. Requires G4 clarification.

### L2. Autonomy Clock — Zero Days Despite RUNNING

```sql
SELECT state, consecutive_days, total_autonomous_days, longest_streak, last_tick_at
FROM fhq_governance.autonomy_clock_state;
-- state=RUNNING, consecutive_days=0, total_autonomous_days=0, longest_streak=0
-- last_tick_at=2026-01-19 (15 days ago, never ticked since start)
```

The autonomy clock was started on 2026-01-19 but has never recorded a single autonomous day tick. Either the tick mechanism is broken or no day has met autonomy criteria. This means the system has **zero autonomous operating days** after 34 days of operation.

### L3. ADR Registry — Dual-Column Status Inconsistency

4 ADRs have split status between legacy `adr_status` (APPROVED) and new `status` (DRAFT):

| ADR | adr_status | status | adr_title |
|-----|-----------|--------|-----------|
| ADR-022 | APPROVED | DRAFT | The Autonomous Database Horizon Implementation Charter |
| ADR-023 | APPROVED | DRAFT | MBB Corporate Standards Integration |
| ADR-024 | APPROVED | DRAFT | AEL Phase Gate Protocol |
| MIG-200 | APPROVED | DRAFT | COGNITIVE ENGINES FOUNDATION |

These ADRs have `adr_title` populated (APPROVED path) but `title` is NULL (DRAFT path). Schema migration left inconsistent dual-column state. The `adr_status` column is the canonical authority per ADR-013.

### L4. fhq_ops.v_daemon_health — ALL 9 Components STALE

This is a **different health view** from `fhq_monitoring.daemon_health` (which shows individual daemon heartbeats). The `v_daemon_health` view tracks higher-level system component health:

| Component | Hours Stale | Status |
|-----------|------------|--------|
| EVIDENCE | 43h | STALE |
| NEWS_SENTIMENT | 256h (11 days) | STALE |
| GRAPH | 260h (11 days) | STALE |
| ORCHESTRATOR | 260h (11 days) | STALE |
| GOVERNANCE | 260h (11 days) | STALE |
| DATA | 260h (11 days) | STALE |
| RESEARCH | 260h (11 days) | STALE |
| EXECUTION | 260h (11 days) | STALE |
| INFRASTRUCTURE | 260h (11 days) | STALE |

**Analysis:** Individual daemons (finn_brain_scheduler, etc.) are heartbeating to `fhq_monitoring.daemon_health`, but the component-level aggregation in `fhq_ops.v_daemon_health` is NOT being updated. 8 of 9 components last heartbeat was 2026-01-23 — the day the daemon hygiene directive was issued. The view or its source tables were abandoned during the hygiene restructure.

**Impact:** The CEO control room dashboard likely reads from `v_daemon_health` and would show ALL STALE even though individual daemons are actually running. This is a **dashboard truthfulness gap**.

### L5. Empty Governance State Tables

```sql
SELECT count(*) FROM fhq_governance.system_state;        -- 0 rows
SELECT count(*) FROM fhq_governance.system_state_flags;   -- 0 rows
SELECT count(*) FROM fhq_governance.governance_state;     -- 0 rows
SELECT count(*) FROM fhq_meta.source_of_truth;            -- 0 rows
```

These tables exist but contain no data. Either they were never populated, or they were cleared during a migration.

### L6. 13 Executive Roles — Full Hierarchy Confirmed

| Role | Authority Level | Type | Domain |
|------|----------------|------|--------|
| CEO | 10 | human | Ultimate authority |
| VEGA | 10 | ai_agent | Governance |
| LARS | 9 | ai_agent | Strategy |
| FINN | 8 | ai_agent | Research |
| LINE | 8 | ai_agent | Operations |
| STIG | 8 | ai_agent | Database/Tech |
| CDMO | 7 | ai_agent | Data Memory |
| CEIO | 7 | ai_agent | External Intel |
| CFAO | 7 | ai_agent | Foresight |
| CRIO | 7 | ai_agent | Research Insight |
| CSEO | 7 | ai_agent | Strategy Execution |
| CODE | 6 | ai_agent | Execution unit |
| CPTO | 2 | Sub-Executive | Signal-to-Order |

### L7. Circuit Breakers — 15 Active, All Enabled

All 15 circuit breakers are `is_enabled=true`. No breakers currently tripped (DEFCON GREEN). Includes BLACK-level `GOVERNANCE_BREACH` and RED-level `FLASH_CRASH`, `PORTFOLIO_DRAWDOWN_10PCT`, `API_KEY_FAILURE`, `SYSTEM_ERROR_RATE`.

### L8. Disk vs Database Discrepancy — EC, Daemon, IoS

Full filesystem scan reveals significant gaps between what exists on disk and what is registered in the database:

**Employment Contracts:**
| Location | Count | IDs |
|----------|-------|-----|
| Disk (`10_EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS/`) | **20 files** | EC-001 through EC-022 (gaps at 016/017) |
| Database (`fhq_governance.ec_registry`) | **5 rows** | EC-014, EC-018, EC-020, EC-021, EC-022 |
| **Unregistered** | **15 ECs** | EC-001 to EC-013, EC-015, EC-019 |

All core executive contracts (VEGA EC-001, LARS EC-002, STIG EC-003, etc.) exist as files but are absent from ec_registry.

**Daemons:**
| Location | Count |
|----------|-------|
| Disk (`03_FUNCTIONS/*.py` daemon files) | **39 implementations** |
| Database (`fhq_monitoring.daemon_health`) | **21 registered** |
| **Unregistered** | **18 daemons** |

Unregistered daemons include: `cco_daemon`, `orchestrator_daemon`, `ec018_alpha_daemon`, `g2c_alpha_daemon`, `broker_reconciliation_daemon`, `exit_detection_daemon`, `ceo_gateway_daemon`, `epistemic_proposal_daemon`, `ios010_outcome_capture_daemon`, `court_proof_verification_daemon`, `evidence_unification_daemon`, `signal_executor_daemon`, `ceio_evidence_refresh_daemon`, `subexec_heartbeat_daemon`, `ios003c_shadow_learning_daemon`, `ios012b_shadow_signal_daemon`, `ios012b_exit_sentinel_daemon`, `canonical_test_orchestrator_daemon`.

**IoS Modules:**
| Location | Count |
|----------|-------|
| Disk (`02_IOS/` spec files) | **20+ specs** (includes sub-modules 003B, 003C, 012-B, 012-C) |
| Database (`fhq_meta.ios_registry`) | **20 entries** |
| Disk function implementations (`03_FUNCTIONS/`) | **76+ Python modules** |
| **Coverage:** Specs match registry. Implementations exceed spec count (multiple modules per IoS).

**Infrastructure Inventory (Disk):**
| Category | Count |
|----------|-------|
| ADR documents (`00_CONSTITUTION/`) | 26 |
| EC documents (`10_EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS/`) | 20 |
| IoS specifications (`02_IOS/`) | 20+ |
| Daemon implementations | 39 |
| IoS function modules | 76+ |
| Database migrations (`04_DATABASE/MIGRATIONS/`) | 387 |
| Evidence files (`03_FUNCTIONS/evidence/`) | 6,055 |
| Governance records (`05_GOVERNANCE/`) | 100+ |
| CEO Shadow directives | 59 daily |
| Task scheduler configs (.bat + .ps1) | 36 |
| Agent Phase3 specs (`04_AGENTS/PHASE3/`) | 4 |

### L10. CRASHING DAEMONS — Silent Failures (4 broken, running daily but failing)

These daemons are scheduled and executing on time via Windows Task Scheduler, but **crash on every run**. They appear "Ready" in Task Scheduler but produce zero useful output.

**1. Canonical Test Orchestrator** — CRASHING SINCE 2026-01-26 (10 consecutive days)
```
Error: column "recommended_actions" is of type jsonb but expression is of type text[]
File: canonical_test_orchestrator_daemon.py, line 230 (escalate_test function)
Impact: TEST-EC022-OBS-001 escalation cannot be written. Test orchestration is dead.
```

**2. LDOW Cycle Daemon** — MISCONFIGURED since 2026-01-18
```
Error: the following arguments are required: --cycle
Root cause: .bat file does not pass --cycle argument
Impact: LDOW cycle evaluations never execute
```

**3. Error Detector Daemon** — BROKEN since 2026-01-23
```
Error: column ol.symbol does not exist in fhq_research.outcome_ledger
Impact: Automated error detection is offline. Errors go undetected.
```

**4. Ops Phase2 Registration** — BROKEN since 2026-01-29
```
Error: cannot insert into generated columns (tier_name, parameter_count)
Impact: Registration pipeline non-functional
```

**Combined Impact:** The error detector that should catch bugs is itself broken. The test orchestrator that should validate the system is crashing. These are meta-failures — the systems designed to find problems are themselves the problem.

### L11. Inactive/Stale Daemons (10 — last activity >7 days ago)

| Daemon | Last Activity | Notes |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| Sentinel | 2026-01-05 | SHADOW mode heartbeat, no recent |
| Signal Executor | 2025-12-18 | PAPER mode, not running |
| Wave 15 Hunter | 2025-12-22 | Golden needle hunter, abandoned |
| S-Tier Exit Monitor | 2025-12-29 | Crashed on DB connection |
| Wave 17C Promotion | 2025-12-19 | Shadow mode promotion |
| IoS-003B Intraday Regime | 2025-12-19 | 15-min regime delta |
| Economic Outcome Daemon | 2026-01-25 | FRED ICSA, constraint error |
| CCO Daemon | 2025-12-18 | Explicitly DISABLED |
| Experiment Runner | 2026-01-23 | Found 0 hypotheses |
| Daemon Watchdog | 2026-01-26 | Login-triggered, stale |

### L9. Key Governance Finding: Registry Incompleteness

The database registries were clearly restructured at some point (likely during the daemon hygiene directive on DAY25). The result is that the ec_registry only holds cognitive authority sub-executives, while the core executive contracts exist only as files and in `fhq_governance.executive_roles`. Similarly, only 21 of 39 daemon implementations are tracked in daemon_health.

This means **the database is NOT the single source of truth for ECs and daemons**, violating ADR-013 (One-True-Source). The filesystem contains the complete picture; the database contains a subset.

### Branch Name Deviation

Directive specifies `main`. Actual branch is `master`. No rename performed — requires explicit CEO order to rename. Documented as known deviation.

### Reality Check: Does database conform to canonical definitions at commit c6f52f69?

| Category | Git (Canonical) | Database | Verdict |
|----------|----------------|----------|---------|
| ADRs | 25 files in `00_CONSTITUTION/` | 26 in `fhq_meta.adr_registry` (incl. MIG-200) | **DEVIATION** |
| ECs | 21 files in `10_EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS/` | 5 in `fhq_governance.ec_registry` | **DEVIATION** |
| IoS | 17 unique specs in `02_IOS/` | 20 in `fhq_meta.ios_registry` | **DEVIATION** |

### Deviation Details (Observation Only — No Corrections Applied)

**ADR:** Database has 26 rows; disk has 25 files. Extra row is `MIG-200` (migration artifact, no corresponding ADR file on disk).

**EC:** Database has 5 rows (EC-014, EC-018, EC-020, EC-021, EC-022). Disk has 21 files (EC-001 through EC-022 with gaps at 016/017). 16 EC files have no database registration. Registry was restructured to hold only cognitive authority sub-executives.

**IoS:** Database has 20 rows. Disk has 17 unique IoS numbers (some with sub-modules 003B, 003C, 012-B, 012-C). Database includes entries (ALPHA-GRAPH-001, G4.2, G5) that have no matching IoS spec file on disk.

### Prohibitions Honored

- NO automated GitOps or auto-sync implemented
- NO security or key-rotation changes
- NO "make status green" database modifications
- NO reinterpretation as rebuild/migration
- Divergence observed and reported. Not corrected.

## CEO DIRECTIVE 2026-004 — One-Time Governance Reconciliation

**Executed:** 2026-02-03 ~11:50 CET (database clock verified)
**Executor:** STIG (EC-003)
**Scope:** One-way Git → DB reconciliation. Governance registries only.
**Canonical commit:** c6f52f6902b9d97318c6393eb8f439fe890307e9

### Precondition Verification

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| A: Commit lock (HEAD = anchor SHA) | **PASS** |
| B: Evidence bundle written to disk | **PASS** — `CEO_DIR_004_DRY_RUN_AMENDED_20260203.json` |
| C: Fail-closed transaction | **PASS** — all writes in single BEGIN/COMMIT |

### Infrastructure Discovery (During Execution)

`fhq_governance.ec_registry` is **write-locked** by 4 triggers (`block_ec_registry_writes`) per `CEO-DIR-2026-109`. The canonical EC register has moved to `fhq_meta.vega_employment_contract`. Transaction revised to target the correct table. First attempt rolled back cleanly (fail-closed verified).

### Operations Executed (Single Transaction — COMMITTED)

| # | Operation | Table | Detail | Result |
|---|-----------|-------|--------|--------|
| 1 | DELETE | `fhq_meta.adr_registry` | MIG-200 (ghost — no file on disk) | DELETE 1 |
| 2 | DELETE | `fhq_meta.ios_registry` | ALPHA-GRAPH-001, G4.2, G5 (ghosts) | DELETE 3 |
| 3a | INSERT | `fhq_meta.vega_employment_contract` | EC-007-CDMO (CDMO — disambiguated from EC-007 CFAO) | INSERT 1 |
| 3b | UPDATE | `fhq_meta.vega_employment_contract` | EC-005 reports_to: LARS → STIG | UPDATE 1 |
| 3c | UPDATE | `fhq_meta.vega_employment_contract` | EC-009 reports_to: LARS → STIG | UPDATE 1 |
| 3d | UPDATE | `fhq_meta.vega_employment_contract` | EC-012 reports_to: STIG → LARS | UPDATE 1 |
| 3e | UPDATE | `fhq_meta.vega_employment_contract` | EC-018 status: ACTIVE → PENDING_REGISTRATION | UPDATE 1 |
| 3f | UPDATE | `fhq_meta.vega_employment_contract` | EC-019 status: ACTIVE → PENDING_REGISTRATION | UPDATE 1 |
| 4 | UPDATE | `fhq_governance.canonical_truth_anchor` | canonical_branch ratified as 'master' | UPDATE 1 |

### Post-State Verification

```sql
SELECT count(*) FROM fhq_meta.adr_registry;            -- 25
SELECT count(*) FROM fhq_meta.ios_registry;             -- 17
SELECT count(*) FROM fhq_meta.vega_employment_contract; -- 22
```

| Category | Git (Canonical) | Database | Verdict |
|----------|----------------|----------|---------|
| ADR | 25 files in `00_CONSTITUTION/` | 25 in `fhq_meta.adr_registry` | **MATCH** |
| EC | 21 files in `10_EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS/` | 22 in `fhq_meta.vega_employment_contract` | **DEVIATION** (1 ghost) |
| IoS | 17 specs in `02_IOS/` | 17 in `fhq_meta.ios_registry` | **MATCH** |

### EC Residual Deviation

EC-016 (VALKYRIE) exists in `vega_employment_contract` but has no corresponding file in `10_EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS/`. Not on the authorized deletion whitelist. Reported as ghost — requires separate CEO authorization to resolve.

### Unresolved Items (Require CEO Decision)

| # | Item | Action Required |
|---|------|----------------|
| 1 | EC-016 VALKYRIE ghost | Authorize deletion from `vega_employment_contract`, or provide canonical file |
| 2 | `fhq_governance.ec_registry` (deprecated, 5 frozen rows) | Drop table or maintain as archive |
| 3 | EC-007 number collision (CFAO + CDMO) | Assign permanent unique EC number to CDMO |
| 4 | EC-018/EC-019 status | `PENDING_REGISTRATION` (truncated from file text due to varchar(20) constraint) — confirm acceptable |

### Evidence Bundle

- `03_FUNCTIONS/evidence/CEO_DIR_004_DRY_RUN_20260203.json` — original dry-run (pre-blocker discovery)
- `03_FUNCTIONS/evidence/CEO_DIR_004_DRY_RUN_AMENDED_20260203.json` — amended dry-run after infrastructure discovery

### Prohibitions Honored

- NO auto-sync pipelines created
- NO runtime or security changes
- NO manual edits to "make green" — EC-016 ghost reported honestly
- NO scope expansion beyond governance registries

## CEO ORDER — EC-016 VALKYRIE Canonicalization

**Executed:** 2026-02-03 ~13:15 CET
**Executor:** STIG (EC-003)

### Action Taken

Created canonical contract file `10_EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS/EC-016_VALKYRIE.md` based on:
- DB record in `fhq_meta.vega_employment_contract` (contract_id=35)
- Evidence narrative `VALKYRIE_EC016_NARRATIVE_001_20260121.md`
- VEGA signature `VEGA_EC016_VALKYRIE_20260120_a3c7e9f1`

VALKYRIE role: Strategic Storyteller & Narrative Intelligence Officer. Tier-2, reports to CEO.

```

### Final Governance Registry Status (Post-Reconciliation)

| Category | Git (Canonical) | Database | Verdict |
|----------|----------------|----------|---------|
| ADR | 25 files in `00_CONSTITUTION/` | 25 in `fhq_meta.adr_registry` | **MATCH** |
| EC | 22 files in `10_EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS/` | 22 in `fhq_meta.vega_employment_contract` | **MATCH** |
| IoS | 17 specs in `02_IOS/` | 17 in `fhq_meta.ios_registry` | **MATCH** |

### Evidence

- Commit SHA: `c63ff61dbf2936778318fc2d221ec5d3c63743f5`
- EC-only upsert: not needed — EC-016 already existed in DB, file canonicalized ghost
- Pre-count: 21 files / 22 DB rows (DEVIATION)
- Post-count: 22 files / 22 DB rows (MATCH)

## CEO DIRECTIVE 2026-005 — Daemon Resuscitation & Signal Reactivation

**Directive:** DIR-005 DRP (Daemon Resuscitation Protocol)
**Executed:** 2026-02-03 15:31 CET (database-verified)
**Executor:** STIG (EC-003)

### Daemon Status Summary

| # | Daemon | Priority | Fix Applied | Test Result | Status |
|---|--------|----------|-------------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Error Detector | P0 | None needed — DB function already fixed (migration 334b) | 100 errors, 93% hypothesis rate, clean run | **ONLINE** |
| 2 | Canonical Test Orchestrator | P0 | JSONB serialization (lines 235, 469) + CHECK constraint | 4 tests processed, 0 errors | **ONLINE** |
| 3 | LDOW Cycle Daemon | P0 | `run_ldow_daemon.ps1` — `--cycle` param support | Accepts arg, DATA_BLACKOUT (runtime, not code) | **CODE FIXED** |
| 4 | Ops Phase2 Registration | P0 | Two relative path bugs (lines 37, 296) | 6 experiments COMPLETED, evidence written | **ONLINE** |

### Code Changes

**`canonical_test_orchestrator_daemon.py`:**
- Line 235: `recommended_actions = %s` → `%s::jsonb` with `json_dumps(actions)`
- Line 469: `ARRAY[...]` → `%s::jsonb` with `json_dumps([...])`

**`run_ldow_daemon.ps1`:**
- Added `param([int]$Cycle = 0)` block
- Conditional: `$Cycle -gt 0` passes `--cycle $Cycle`; else runs both cycles sequentially

**`ops_phase2_registration.py`:**
- Line 37: relative log path → `os.path.join(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)), ...)`
- Line 296: relative evidence path → same `os.path.dirname` pattern

### Database Changes (DIR-005)

```sql
ALTER TABLE fhq_calendar.ceo_calendar_alerts
    DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS ceo_calendar_alerts_alert_type_check,
    ADD CONSTRAINT ceo_calendar_alerts_alert_type_check
    CHECK (alert_type IN ('DEADLINE','MILESTONE','RISK','ESCALATION','TEST_ESCALATION'));
```

### LDOW DATA_BLACKOUT Note

Code fix verified. DATA_BLACKOUT caused by stale regime data (15.4h old at test time) — runtime data freshness issue, not code defect. Normal daemon cycling resolves this.

## Section 2: Directive A - Fast-Track G1 Infrastructure

### Purpose

Accelerate low-risk learning parameter adjustments without bypassing governance.

### DEFCON Binding (ADR-016 - CRITICAL)

| DEFCON State | Fast-Track Status |
|--------------|-------------------|
| GREEN | Enabled |
| YELLOW | Enabled |
| ORANGE | **SUSPENDED** - All new approvals and pending cycles halted |
| RED | **DISABLED** |
| BLACK | **DISABLED** |

**Violation of DEFCON gate is a Class A governance breach.**

### Initial Fast-Track Parameters

| Parameter | Scope | Max Delta | Cooldown | Auto-G1 |
|-----------|-------|-----------|----------|---------|
| confidence_damper_alpha | damper | 10% | 24h | YES |
| confidence_damper_beta | damper | 10% | 24h | YES |
| ldow_coverage_threshold | threshold | 5% | 48h | YES |
| ldow_stability_threshold | threshold | 2% | 48h | YES |

### Verification

|-------|--------|
| DEFCON gate function | PASS (returns TRUE in GREEN) |
| Eligibility check function | PASS (tested with 5% delta) |
| VEGA audit mandatory | ENFORCED |

**Migration:** 252_fast_track_g1_infrastructure.sql

---

## Section 3: Directive B - CFAO × CRIO Synthetic Integration

### Architecture

```
CFAO Shadow Mode → Synthetic Scenarios → CRIO Falsification → UMA Analysis
```

### Tables Created

| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| fhq_research.synthetic_scenarios | Store synthetic regime scenarios |
| fhq_research.counterfactual_tags | Link scenarios to counterfactual analysis |
| fhq_research.crio_falsification_queue | Queue for CRIO validation |
| fhq_research.uma_preparedness_analysis | Daily UMA preparedness reports |

### Key Constraints

1. **Synthetic Never Canonical:** `is_canonical = FALSE` enforced via CHECK constraint
2. **LVI Not Stored:** Only `learning_signal_weight` - LVI computed at aggregation layer only

### Integration Flow

1. CFAO generates synthetic scenarios (24/7 shadow mode)
2. Scenarios tagged with counterfactual metadata
3. CRIO falsification runs against synthetic data
4. UMA compares synthetic-trained readiness vs real regime shifts
5. UMA calculates preparedness gap → feeds into LVI

**Migration:** 253_cfao_crio_synthetic_integration.sql

---

## Section 4: Directive C - VEGA Constitutional Feedback Loop

### Purpose

Close the loop: Learning outcomes → Governance adjustments → Better learning

### Scope Limitation (Constitutional Boundary)

**VEGA feedback CANNOT amend ADR text.** Feedback is limited to:
- Gate thresholds (e.g., coverage %, stability %)
- Operational parameters (e.g., damper coefficients, cooldowns)
- Procedural interpretations already permitted by ADR-004

ADR text amendments require full G4 CEO approval through standard process.

### DEFCON Integration (Per EC-014 Section 7.2)

| DEFCON | UMA Operation |
|--------|---------------|
| GREEN/YELLOW | Full operation |
| ORANGE | Latency reduction only |
| RED | Analysis-only, no recommendations |
| BLACK | UMA suspended |

**Migration:** 254_vega_feedback_loop.sql

## Section 7: What We Deliberately Did NOT Do (Negative Controls)

For audit defensibility:

1. Did NOT give UMA execution authority (advisory only per EC-014 Section 6)
2. Did NOT allow Fast-Track to bypass VEGA audit
3. Did NOT enable Fast-Track outside DEFCON GREEN/YELLOW
4. Did NOT store LVI as partial contributions (computed only at aggregation)
5. Did NOT allow VEGA feedback to amend ADR text
6. Did NOT treat synthetic scenarios as canonical truth

## Section 9: CEO Directive 2026-01-16B - UMA Operational Activation

### Directive Status

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Directive ID | CEO-DIR-2026-01-16B |
| Title | Automated Activation of UMA |
| Status | ACTIVE |
| Signed By | CEO (Ørjan Skjold) |

### Constitutional Confirmation

All preconditions satisfied:
- EC-014 registered and signed
- Migrations 251-254 deployed and verified
- DEFCON bindings active
- ADR immutability checks active
- Synthetic isolation active
- Tier-2 Meta-Executive constraints enforced

### UMA Daily Operating Loop (Authoritative)

| Phase | Time | Action |
|-------|------|--------|
| Ingest | T+00h | Last 7 Daily Reports, CFAO synthetic outputs, DEFCON state |
| Mapping | T+01h | Identify frictions: hypothesis, falsification, governance, validation |
| Ranking | T+02h | Rank by expected marginal LVI uplift |
| Signaling | T+03h | Issue max 2 recommendations |
| Audit | T+04h | Sign with Ed25519, submit to VEGA |

### Mandatory Stop Conditions (HARD Rules)

UMA must recommend **no action** if ANY of the following hold:

1. **DEFCON >= ORANGE**
2. **LVI improvement driven by single hypothesis class**
3. **Synthetic performance diverges from canonical validation**
4. **Friction removal would expand execution authority**
5. **VEGA flags metric integrity risk**

> Learning speed is subordinate to capital safety and regime integrity.

### Explicit Exclusions

**Ranking Phase (T+02h) - May NOT consider:**
- Execution optimization
- PnL chasing
- Model micro-tuning outside Fast-Track scope

**Signaling Phase (T+03h) - May NOT recommend:**
- Strategy changes
- Parameter enforcement
- Capital allocation suggestions

**LVI Governance - May NOT justify:**
- Increased risk
- Relaxed capital constraints
- Execution autonomy

### CEO Override Authority

The CEO retains **absolute authority** to:
- Pause UMA recommendations
- Reset LVI baselines
- Restrict Fast-Track scopes
- Freeze learning during regime uncertainty

> No learning system supersedes human capital sovereignty.

### Strategic Closure

With this directive:
- **Learning** is no longer accidental
- **Speed** is no longer chaotic
- **Intelligence** compounds under control
- **Freedom** is achieved through governed acceleration, not reckless speed

## Section 10: Morning Status Update (08:00 Local)

### Overnight Summary

| Event | Time (UTC) | Result |
|-------|------------|--------|
| Cycle 1 Execution | 00:03:05 | **SUCCESS** - 468 forecasts, 100% coverage, Brier 0.48 |
| Cycle 2 Attempt | 01:30:01 | COVERAGE_FAIL - 0 forecasts (expected gap) |
| Root Cause Documented | 07:xx | FORECAST_GAP - normal cadence |
| Retry Authorized | 07:xx | Scheduled 2026-01-17 00:15 UTC |

### What "Activate UMA" Means (CEO Clarification)

**Activation = Allow next control round. Nothing more.**

It means exactly three things:

1. **Document why Cycle 2 stopped** → DONE
   - "Cycle 2 ran before new forecasts were eligible. This is expected cadence, not an error."

2. **Authorize retry in next valid window** → DONE
   - Tonight, after new forecasts are eligible (00:15 UTC)

3. **Let UMA do its job without human intervention**
   - Same rules
   - Same stillness
   - Same discipline
   - No adjustments. No interpretation underway.

### What "Activate UMA" Does NOT Mean

| Forbidden | Reason |
|-----------|--------|
| Change parameters | Violates stillness |
| Make UMA "more active" | UMA is a reviewer, not a trader |
| Adjust dampers | Requires G4 approval |
| Interpret numbers now | Wait for data |
| Push for Rung D | Requires 2 clean cycles |

### Correct Mental Model

> **UMA is a learning auditor, not a trader.**
> **Activation = permit next control round.**
> **Not = do something new.**

## Section 12: Learning Insights (Database-Verified)

**Query Timestamp:** 2026-01-16T18:30:00 UTC
**Source:** `fhq_governance.brier_score_ledger`, `fhq_governance.ldow_forecast_captures`

### Brier Score Performance by Regime (Today)

```sql
SELECT regime, COUNT(*), AVG(squared_error), AVG(forecast_probability)
FROM fhq_governance.brier_score_ledger
WHERE created_at >= CURRENT_DATE GROUP BY regime;
```

| Regime | Samples | Brier | Confidence | Hit Rate | vs All-Time |
|--------|---------|-------|------------|----------|-------------|
| BEAR | 122 | 0.5964 | 87.3% | 25.4% | +0.084 (worse) |
| BULL | 251 | 0.6105 | 90.0% | 26.7% | -0.028 (better) |
| NEUTRAL | 150 | 0.5292 | 84.3% | 32.0% | -0.012 (better) |
| STRESS | 20 | **0.8351** | 90.0% | **0.0%** | +0.040 (worse) |
| **TOTAL** | **543** | **0.5931** | 87.8% | ~27% | - |

### Key Learning #1: STRESS Regime Remains Broken

| Metric | Value | Assessment |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Hit Rate | 0.0% | Complete failure |
| Brier Score | 0.8351 | Near-random performance |
| Sample Size | 20 | Sufficient for signal |
| Status | **FROZEN** | Per Day 8 P0/P1 repair |

**Root Cause:** Definition mismatch between forecast conditions and outcome measurement. STRESS remains frozen with 0.50 confidence cap until definitional repair.

### Key Learning #2: Brier Trend (7-Day Rolling)

```sql
SELECT DATE(created_at), COUNT(*), AVG(squared_error)
FROM fhq_governance.brier_score_ledger
WHERE created_at >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY DATE(created_at) ORDER BY 1 DESC;
```

| Date | Samples | Brier | Trend |
|------|---------|-------|-------|
| Jan 16 | 543 | 0.5931 | UP (worse) |
| Jan 15 | 488 | 0.5254 | - |
| Jan 14 | 478 | 0.5126 | Best |
| Jan 13 | 295 | 0.5663 | - |
| Jan 12 | 173 | 0.4705 | - |
| Jan 11 | 94 | 0.4531 | - |
| Jan 09 | 275 | 0.5183 | - |
| Jan 08 | 879 | 0.6986 | Worst |

**Observation:** Today's Brier (0.5931) increased from yesterday (0.5254). This is expected variance, not a trend reversal. The 7-day average shows improvement from Jan 8 baseline.

### Key Learning #3: Damper Effectiveness

```sql
SELECT AVG(raw_confidence), AVG(damped_confidence), AVG(dampening_delta)
FROM fhq_governance.ldow_forecast_captures WHERE captured_at >= '2026-01-15';
```

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Forecasts | 888 |
| Avg Raw Confidence | 75.1% |
| Avg Damped Confidence | 49.4% |
| Avg Dampening Delta | **25.7%** |
| Min Dampening | 0.0% |
| Max Dampening | 51.9% |

**Assessment:** Damper is functioning as designed. Reducing overconfidence by ~26 percentage points on average. Maximum dampening of 51.9% applied to highest-confidence forecasts.

### Key Learning #4: Regime Calibration Quality

| Regime | Calibration Assessment |
|--------|------------------------|
| NEUTRAL | **Best calibrated** - 32% hit rate with 84% confidence |
| BULL | **Overconfident** - 90% confidence yields only 27% hit rate |
| BEAR | **Degrading** - Brier increased +8.4% vs historical |
| STRESS | **Broken** - 0% hit rate, definitionally invalid |

### Key Learning #5: LDOW Execution Integrity

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Cycles Completed (Jan 15) | 70 (cycles 86-159) |
| Success Rate | 100% |
| Lineage Coverage | 100% |
| Damper Hash Verified | All cycles |
| Parameter Changes | 0 (stillness maintained) |

### Learning Synthesis

| Observation | Implication | Action |
|-------------|-------------|--------|
| NEUTRAL best hit rate (32%) | System most calibrated in normal markets | Continue observation |
| BULL overconfident (90%→27%) | Damper may need BULL-specific tuning | UMA to analyze |
| BEAR degraded today (+8.4%) | Potential regime-shift signal | Monitor tomorrow |
| STRESS 0% hit rate | Definition problem confirmed | Await G4 repair |
| Damper reduces ~26% | Working as designed | No change needed |

### Stillness Compliance

| Check | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Damper parameters unchanged | VERIFIED |
| No manual interventions | VERIFIED |
| Observation-only mode | ACTIVE |
| UMA recommendations | 0 (not yet executed first loop) |

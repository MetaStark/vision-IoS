| Effective Date | 2026-01-16 |

### Agent Profile

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Agent Name | UMA |
| Full Name | Universal Meta-Analyst |
| Classification | Tier-2 Meta-Executive |

| fhq_governance.agent_mandates | INSERTED |
| fhq_org.org_agents | INSERTED |
| fhq_governance.ec_registry | INSERTED |

**Migration:** 251_uma_registration.sql

## Section 2: Directive A - Fast-Track G1 Infrastructure

### Purpose

Accelerate low-risk learning parameter adjustments without bypassing governance.

### DEFCON Binding (ADR-016 - CRITICAL)

| DEFCON State | Fast-Track Status |
|--------------|-------------------|
| GREEN | Enabled |
| YELLOW | Enabled |
| ORANGE | **SUSPENDED** - All new approvals and pending cycles halted |
| RED | **DISABLED** |
| BLACK | **DISABLED** |

**Violation of DEFCON gate is a Class A governance breach.**

### Initial Fast-Track Parameters

| Parameter | Scope | Max Delta | Cooldown | Auto-G1 |
|-----------|-------|-----------|----------|---------|
| confidence_damper_alpha | damper | 10% | 24h | YES |
| confidence_damper_beta | damper | 10% | 24h | YES |
| ldow_coverage_threshold | threshold | 5% | 48h | YES |
| ldow_stability_threshold | threshold | 2% | 48h | YES |

### Verification

| Check | Status |
|-------|--------|
| DEFCON gate function | PASS (returns TRUE in GREEN) |
| Eligibility check function | PASS (tested with 5% delta) |
| VEGA audit mandatory | ENFORCED |

**Migration:** 252_fast_track_g1_infrastructure.sql

## Section 3: Directive B - CFAO × CRIO Synthetic Integration

### Architecture

```
CFAO Shadow Mode → Synthetic Scenarios → CRIO Falsification → UMA Analysis
```

### Tables Created

| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| fhq_research.synthetic_scenarios | Store synthetic regime scenarios |
| fhq_research.counterfactual_tags | Link scenarios to counterfactual analysis |
| fhq_research.crio_falsification_queue | Queue for CRIO validation |
| fhq_research.uma_preparedness_analysis | Daily UMA preparedness reports |

### Key Constraints

1. **Synthetic Never Canonical:** `is_canonical = FALSE` enforced via CHECK constraint
2. **LVI Not Stored:** Only `learning_signal_weight` - LVI computed at aggregation layer only

### Integration Flow

1. CFAO generates synthetic scenarios (24/7 shadow mode)
2. Scenarios tagged with counterfactual metadata
3. CRIO falsification runs against synthetic data
4. UMA compares synthetic-trained readiness vs real regime shifts
5. UMA calculates preparedness gap → feeds into LVI

**Migration:** 253_cfao_crio_synthetic_integration.sql

---

## Section 4: Directive C - VEGA Constitutional Feedback Loop

### Purpose

Close the loop: Learning outcomes → Governance adjustments → Better learning

### Scope Limitation (Constitutional Boundary)

**VEGA feedback CANNOT amend ADR text.** Feedback is limited to:
- Gate thresholds (e.g., coverage %, stability %)
- Operational parameters (e.g., damper coefficients, cooldowns)
- Procedural interpretations already permitted by ADR-004

ADR text amendments require full G4 CEO approval through standard process.

### DEFCON Integration (Per EC-014 Section 7.2)

| DEFCON | UMA Operation |
|--------|---------------|
| GREEN/YELLOW | Full operation |
| ORANGE | Latency reduction only |
| RED | Analysis-only, no recommendations |
| BLACK | UMA suspended |

**Migration:** 254_vega_feedback_loop.sql

## Section 7: What We Deliberately Did NOT Do (Negative Controls)

For audit defensibility:

1. Did NOT give UMA execution authority (advisory only per EC-014 Section 6)
2. Did NOT allow Fast-Track to bypass VEGA audit
3. Did NOT enable Fast-Track outside DEFCON GREEN/YELLOW
4. Did NOT store LVI as partial contributions (computed only at aggregation)
5. Did NOT allow VEGA feedback to amend ADR text
6. Did NOT treat synthetic scenarios as canonical truth

## Section 9: CEO Directive 2026-01-16B - UMA Operational Activation

### Directive Status

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Directive ID | CEO-DIR-2026-01-16B |
| Title | Automated Activation of UMA |
| Status | ACTIVE |
| Signed By | CEO (Ørjan Skjold) |

### Constitutional Confirmation

All preconditions satisfied:
- EC-014 registered and signed
- Migrations 251-254 deployed and verified
- DEFCON bindings active
- ADR immutability checks active
- Synthetic isolation active
- Tier-2 Meta-Executive constraints enforced

### UMA Daily Operating Loop (Authoritative)

| Phase | Time | Action |
|-------|------|--------|
| Ingest | T+00h | Last 7 Daily Reports, CFAO synthetic outputs, DEFCON state |
| Mapping | T+01h | Identify frictions: hypothesis, falsification, governance, validation |
| Ranking | T+02h | Rank by expected marginal LVI uplift |
| Signaling | T+03h | Issue max 2 recommendations |
| Audit | T+04h | Sign with Ed25519, submit to VEGA |

### Mandatory Stop Conditions (HARD Rules)

UMA must recommend **no action** if ANY of the following hold:

1. **DEFCON >= ORANGE**
2. **LVI improvement driven by single hypothesis class**
3. **Synthetic performance diverges from canonical validation**
4. **Friction removal would expand execution authority**
5. **VEGA flags metric integrity risk**

> Learning speed is subordinate to capital safety and regime integrity.

### Explicit Exclusions

**Ranking Phase (T+02h) - May NOT consider:**
- Execution optimization
- PnL chasing
- Model micro-tuning outside Fast-Track scope

**Signaling Phase (T+03h) - May NOT recommend:**
- Strategy changes
- Parameter enforcement
- Capital allocation suggestions

**LVI Governance - May NOT justify:**
- Increased risk
- Relaxed capital constraints
- Execution autonomy

### CEO Override Authority

The CEO retains **absolute authority** to:
- Pause UMA recommendations
- Reset LVI baselines
- Restrict Fast-Track scopes
- Freeze learning during regime uncertainty

> No learning system supersedes human capital sovereignty.

### Strategic Closure

With this directive:
- **Learning** is no longer accidental
- **Speed** is no longer chaotic
- **Intelligence** compounds under control
- **Freedom** is achieved through governed acceleration, not reckless speed

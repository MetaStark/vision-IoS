## SESSION LOG

### 06:49 CET — P1 INVESTIGATION: Shadow Trade Exit Blockage (COMPLETE)

**Root Cause: Date-vs-Timestamp CET comparison + market timing**

Exit engine (`shadow_trade_exit_engine.py:147`) uses `date > entry_time` where:
- `price_series.date` is type `date`, cast to CET midnight (`2026-02-04` → `2026-02-03T23:00:00Z`)
- `entry_time` is real UTC timestamp (`2026-02-04T21:02:45Z`)
- Result: Feb 4 bar is "invisible" to all 506 trades (CET cast < entry timestamp)

**Trade breakdown:**

| Bucket | Count | Unblocked By |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| Entry before midnight CET Feb 5 | 264 | Feb 5 close (tonight ~22:00 UTC) |
| Entry after midnight CET Feb 5 | 242 | Feb 6 close (tomorrow ~22:00 UTC) |

**All 506 trades have 72h timeframe → TIME_EXPIRY fires Feb 9 (Monday).**
STOP_LOSS (5%) / TAKE_PROFIT (10%) could fire earlier on Feb 5-6 bars.

**Cause chain:**
1. CEO correction #2: `entry_time = NOW()` (real UTC timestamp)
2. Old convention: `entry_time` matched `price_series.date` format (midnight CET)
3. Server timezone `Europe/Oslo` creates 1-hour offset in date→timestamptz cast
4. Trades entered 21:02-06:33 UTC → all after CET midnight → date comparison fails

**Verdict: NOT a blocking bug. Self-corrects within 2-3 trading days.**
72h timeframe provides buffer. No PnL data loss — just delayed.

**Actions:**
- [ ] Ensure ios001_daily_ingest runs tonight for Feb 5 close
- [ ] Run shadow_trade_exit_engine after Feb 5 data lands
- [ ] Monitor yfinance rate-limiting (last run was heavily throttled)

---

### 07:02 CET — P2 INVESTIGATION: Discrepancy Backlog (COMPLETE)

**Source: Single daemon — IoS-014 / STIG (SENTINEL_DB_INTEGRITY bloat watchdog)**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total OPEN events | 1,248 |
| Above threshold (>0.10) | 400 (all score 0.15, type DB_BLOAT_RISK) |
| Below threshold | 848 (score 0.05 or 0.025) |
| Last above-threshold event | Feb 1 04:29 UTC (98h ago) |
| Events/day (recent) | ~6-17, all below threshold |

**Score breakdown:**

| Score | Count | Type |
|-------|-------|------|
| 0.150 | 400 | DB_BLOAT_RISK (CRITICAL) |
| 0.050 | 847 | DB_BLOAT_RISK, SLOW_QUERY, DB_LOCK |
| 0.025 | 1 | DB_BLOAT_RISK |

**Root cause of CRITICAL events: `fhq_market.prices` table bloat**
- Historical: bloat_ratio 0.97 (97% dead tuples, 4016 dead / 114 live)
- **Current state: RESOLVED** — autovacuum fixed it
  - n_live_tup: 882,812 | n_dead_tup: 58,820 | bloat_ratio: 0.0625 (6.25%)
  - last_autovacuum: 2026-02-04 18:53 UTC

**Autonomy clock impact: NONE**
Clock condition 3 checks `discrepancy_score > 0.10` in the **last 24 hours only**.
Last above-threshold event: 98h ago → condition 3 PASSES.
Above-threshold generation stopped after Feb 1 (bloat self-resolved).

**Verdict: Backlog is cosmetic. No blocking impact on autonomy or pipeline.**

**Recommended actions (CEO approval needed for governance writes):**
1. ~~Bulk-resolve 400 historical CRITICAL events~~ **DONE** (1,248 resolved, CEO order)
2. ~~Bulk-resolve 848 informational events~~ **DONE** (included in bulk)
3. Consider adding auto-resolution logic to bloat watchdog daemon

---

### 07:56 CET — P3: LVI Automation (COMPLETE)

**Fresh LVI computation:**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| LVI Score | 0.0055 (F) |
| Completed Experiments | 5 |
| Integrity Rate | 100% |
| Coverage Rate | 29.63% (bottleneck) |
| Median Eval Time | 91.5h |
| Time Factor | 0.10 (capped) |
| Brier Component | 0.3745 |
| Bottleneck | Low coverage rate - events without hypotheses |

**Daemon automation applied to `lvi_calculator.py`:**
- Added daemon heartbeat (daemon_name: `lvi_calculator`)
- Added `--once` and `--interval` flags
- Added logging to `03_FUNCTIONS/lvi_calculator.log`
- Started as background daemon with 6h cycle interval
- Heartbeat: HEALTHY in `fhq_monitoring.daemon_health`
- Fleet status: **24/24 HEALTHY** (was 23/23)

**LVI diagnosis**: Score is near-zero because coverage is 29.6% and median eval time is 91.5h (capped time_factor at 0.10). The learning loop needs more hypothesis-event linkage and faster evaluation cycles. Shadow trade exits (P1) will help feed the learning loop once price data catches up.

### 08:05 CET — P4 INVESTIGATION: Forecast Resolution Pipeline (COMPLETE)

**Mastermap claim: "44,391 unpaired forecasts (71.5%)" — MISLEADING**

The mastermap used `outcome_id IS NULL` as "unpaired". Current state:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total forecasts | 63,083 |
| Resolved | 62,473 (99.03%) |
| Unresolved | 610 (0.97%) |
| Paired with outcome | 57,795 (91.6%) |
| Unpaired (no outcome_id) | 5,288 (8.4%) |

**Unpaired breakdown:**

| Category | Count | Explanation |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| EXPIRED (resolved, no outcome) | 4,678 | Forecast horizon elapsed before outcome data arrived |
| Still within horizon | 598 | Active forecasts, not yet due |
| Expired & unresolved | 12 | BRK.B MODEL_BELIEF_STATE (8h overdue) |

**Resolution quality:**

| Status | Count | % |
|--------|-------|---|
| CORRECT | 31,393 | 50.3% |
| INCORRECT | 26,402 | 42.3% |
| EXPIRED | 4,678 | 7.5% |

**Weekly throughput (last 4 weeks):**

| Week | Resolutions |
|------|------------|
| Feb 2-8 | 7,080 (partial week) |
| Jan 26-Feb 1 | 21,315 |
| Jan 19-25 | 7,328 |
| Jan 12-18 | 6,998 |

**Reconciler vs FINN daemons:**
- `forecast_resolution_log`: Last ran Jan 17, single batch of 3,553. Secondary path.
- FINN daemons (finn_crypto, finn_e, finn_brain, finn_t_scheduler): PRIMARY resolution path. All HEALTHY. Resolve forecasts directly during their cycles.

**BRK.B orphan issue (12 forecasts):**
- All 12 are MODEL_BELIEF_STATE regime forecasts with 24h horizon
- BRK.B consistently rate-limited by yfinance (seen in ios001 ingest logs)
- Without fresh price data, regime forecasts can't resolve
- Earliest expiry: Jan 20, latest: Feb 4 23:00 UTC (8h overdue)

**Verdict: Pipeline is HEALTHY. No action required.**
- Resolution rate: 99.03% (was misreported as 28.5%)
- FINN daemons handle resolution; batch reconciler is supplementary
- 12 BRK.B orphans are cosmetic (yfinance rate-limit artifact)
- EXPIRED forecasts (7.5%) are expected — some horizons elapse without observable outcomes

---

### 08:20 CET — P5 ASSESSMENT: Shadow→Paper Bridge Readiness (COMPLETE)

**State: 0 execution_routing_log entries. Bridge NOT active.**

Four paths exist from shadow to paper. All stalled:

**Path 1: IoS-008 Decision Engine (`shadow_decision_log`)**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total shadow evaluations | 20 |
| PASS (would_have_executed) | 6 |
| BLOCKED_FRESHNESS | 14 (70%) |
| Last evaluation | Jan 13 (23 days ago) |

LIDS_FRESHNESS gate blocks 70% of candidates. Engine has not run since Jan 13.

**Path 2: S-Tier Promotion Queue**

| Status | Count | Last Activity |
|--------|-------|---------------|
| QUEUED | 8 | Dec 27 (40 days stale) |
| EXECUTING | 1 | Dec 27 (stuck, no completion) |
| EXECUTED | 2 | Dec 27 (no outcome recorded) |

All 11 entries from Dec 27 batch. EQS scores high (0.95-0.99). No processing since.

**Path 3: G2C Paper Trades**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total G2C paper trades | 15 |
| Last 7 days | 0 |

G2C daemon is HEALTHY but not producing new paper trades.

**Path 4: Governance Paper Decision Plan**

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Plan Type | DIAGNOSTIC_FIRST_FLIGHT |
| Created By | LARS, Approved By VEGA |
| Created | Jan 10 |
| Status | EXECUTING |
| Positions Planned/Executed | 4/4 |

But: `paper_positions = 0`, `paper_outcomes = 0`. Plan is "executing" with no live positions.

**Execution layer inventory:**

| Table | Count |
|-------|-------|
| paper_orders | 30 (historical) |
| paper_positions | 0 |
| paper_outcomes | 0 |
| execution_routing_log | 0 |
| decision_plans (governance) | 0 |
| decision_packs | 25 (20 FAILED, 5 PENDING) |

**Alpaca paper config:** Active, risk limits configured (10% max position, 15% max drawdown, 5% stop loss).

**Blocking chain analysis:**
```
Shadow Trades (572 OPEN, 0 PnL)
    → need exit/PnL data (blocked by P1: date/timestamp CET issue)
    → feeds promotion_gate evaluation
    → feeds s_tier_promotion_queue
    → feeds execution_routing_log
    → feeds paper_orders → paper_positions
```

**Root blocker: P1 (shadow trade exits).** Until shadow trades close with PnL, the learning loop cannot evaluate strategy profitability for promotion to paper.

**Secondary blockers:**
1. IoS-008 decision engine stale (23 days) — needs fresh shadow decision cycle
2. S-tier queue stuck (40 days) — needs promotion daemon to process QUEUED entries
3. Decision packs: 80% FAILED — pack generation logic needs investigation

**Verdict: Phase 3 NOT READY. Prerequisites unfulfilled.**

**Phase 3 prerequisites (in dependency order):**
1. Shadow trades must close with PnL (P1 self-resolves Feb 5-9)
2. Shadow trade exit data feeds learning loop → LVI improvement
3. Promotion gate re-evaluates strategies with real PnL
4. IoS-008 decision engine needs restart with fresh data
5. S-tier promotion queue needs processing daemon or manual processing
6. Execution routing layer needs activation

**Recommended timeline:**
- Feb 5-9: Shadow trades close (automatic, P1 self-correction)
- Feb 10-12: First PnL batch available, promotion gate can evaluate
- Feb 12+: Earliest Phase 3 activation if PnL data shows promotable strategies

### 08:45 CET — CANONICAL TEST EVALUATION (4 ACTION_REQUIRED Tests)

All 4 tests had `escalation_state: ACTION_REQUIRED`, `ceo_action_required: true`, all metrics N/A.
Root cause: Orchestrator cannot compute test-specific metrics. Manual computation below.

---

#### TEST 1: G1.5 Calibration Freeze (FHQ-EXP-PRETIER-G1.5) — **PASS**

| Metric | Target | Measured | Status |
|--------|--------|----------|--------|
| Spearman rho | > 0.3 | **0.3767** | PASS |
| Pearson r | (secondary) | **0.4169** | PASS |
| Sample size | >= 30 deaths | **974** | PASS |
| Day | 10 of 14 | — | 4 days left |

**Quartile survival analysis (pre_tier_score_at_birth → time_to_falsification):**

| Quartile | Score Range | Median Survival | Avg Survival |
|----------|------------|-----------------|--------------|
| Q1 (worst) | 51-61 | 24.2h | 28.8h |
| Q2 | 61-70 | 29.7h | 33.8h |
| Q3 | 70-81 | 32.4h | 35.9h |
| Q4 (best) | 81 | **72.0h** | **51.7h** |

**Top quartile survives 3x longer than bottom quartile. Clear monotonic gradient.**

**Verdict: SUCCESS. Pre-Tier provides ranking alpha. Recommend CEO close test with PASS.**
- Spearman 0.38 > 0.30 threshold
- 974 samples >> 30 minimum
- Upper quartile survives materially longer than lower quartile
- Mid-test checkpoint (Jan 31) was NOT reviewed — overdue by 5 days

---

#### TEST 2: FINN-T World-Model Alignment (TEST-FINN-T-ALIGN-001) — **PARTIAL PASS**

| Metric | Target | Measured | Status |
|--------|--------|----------|--------|
| Causal depth (FINN-T) | >= 2 | **4.07** | PASS |
| Generator max share | < 60% | **finn_crypto 72.5%** | FAIL |
| FINN-T share (ideation only) | — | **64.3%** | MARGINAL |
| Day | 11 of 14 | — | 3 days left |

**Generator breakdown (all, including scheduler):**

| Generator | Count | Share | Avg Depth |
|-----------|-------|-------|-----------|
| finn_crypto_scheduler | 910 | 72.5% | 3.01 |
| FINN-T | 222 | 17.7% | 4.07 |
| FINN-E | 115 | 9.2% | 1.00 |
| STIG-ALPHA-SAT | 6 | 0.5% | 1.00 |
| GN-S | 2 | 0.2% | 3.50 |

**Ideation generators only (excl. crypto scheduler):**

| Generator | Count | Share | Avg Depth |
|-----------|-------|-------|-----------|
| FINN-T | 222 | 64.3% | 4.07 |
| FINN-E | 115 | 33.3% | 1.00 |
| STIG-ALPHA-SAT | 6 | 1.7% | 1.00 |
| GN-S | 2 | 0.6% | 3.50 |

**Assessment:**
- Depth target EXCEEDED (4.07 vs 2.0) — FINN-T generates high-quality causal hypotheses
- Generator diversity FAILS technically (finn_crypto 72.5% all-in, FINN-T 64.3% ideation-only)
- 4 distinct regimes observed (STANDARD, CRYPTO_DIVERSIFIED, CRYPTO_DEGENERATE, HIGH_CAUSAL_PRESSURE)
- FINN-T is active and productive (222 hypotheses, last: Feb 5 13:33 UTC)

**Verdict: PARTIAL SUCCESS. CEO decision needed.**
- Primary metric (depth) PASSES decisively
- Secondary metric (diversity) FAILS on strict reading
- Mid-test checkpoint (Jan 31) NOT reviewed — overdue by 5 days

---

#### TEST 3: Golden Needles Shadow-Tier (TEST-GN-SHADOW-001) — **FAILURE**

| Metric | Target | Measured | Status |
|--------|--------|----------|--------|
| Shadow hypothesis depth | >= 2 | 3.50 | PASS (on 2 samples) |
| Shadow hypothesis volume | 100 target | **2** | CRITICAL FAIL |
| Epistemic contrast | required | Not measurable | FAIL |
| Day | 11 of 14 | — | 3 days left |

**GN-S hypothesis detail:**

| Code | Status | Depth | Created | Survival | Death Cause |
|------|--------|-------|---------|----------|-------------|
| HYP-2026-0008 | FALSIFIED | 3 | Jan 24 22:04 | 57.5h | HORIZON_EXPIRED (48h) |
| HYP-2026-0009 | FALSIFIED | 4 | Jan 24 22:04 | 57.5h | HORIZON_EXPIRED (48h) |

**Root cause: GN-S generator stopped after Day 1.** Only 2 hypotheses created on Jan 24. No new shadow hypotheses in 11 days. Both were FALSIFIED by horizon expiry (survived Tier-1 but ran out of time).

**Verdict: FAILURE. GN-S generator inactive since Day 1.**
- Volume: 2/100 (2%)
- Cannot measure epistemic contrast with n=2
- Generator needs investigation/restart
- Mid-test checkpoint (Jan 31) NOT reviewed — overdue by 5 days

---

#### TEST 4: EC-022 Reward Logic Freeze (TEST-EC022-OBS-001) — **BLOCKED**

| Metric | Target | Measured | Status |
|--------|--------|----------|--------|
| Independent regimes observed | 2 | **4** | PASS (data available) |
| Drawdown phase observed | 1 | Unknown | PENDING |
| IoS-010 Bridge operational | Required | **NOT operational** | BLOCKER |
| Context lift computed | Required | **Not possible** | BLOCKED |
| Day | 12 of 30 | — | 18 days left |

**Regime coverage:**

| Regime | Count | Period |
|--------|-------|--------|
| CRYPTO_DIVERSIFIED_POST_FIX | 563 | Jan 27 → Feb 5 |
| STANDARD | 342 | Jan 24 → Feb 5 |
| CRYPTO_DEGENERATE_PRE_FIX | 331 | Jan 25 → Jan 27 |
| HIGH_CAUSAL_PRESSURE | 19 | Jan 31 → Feb 5 |

**Blocking issue:** `fhq_execution.learning_updates` has 0 entries. IoS-010 Bridge is not operational. Without it, context lift cannot be measured.

**Verdict: BLOCKED. Not a test failure — infrastructure prerequisite missing.**
- 18 days remaining, test has time
- 4 regimes observed (sufficient regime diversity)
- IoS-010 Bridge activation is the critical path
- No CEO action needed yet — resolve bridge first

---

#### CANONICAL TEST SUMMARY — CEO ACTIONS REQUIRED

| Test | Day | Verdict | CEO Action |
|------|-----|---------|------------|
| G1.5 Calibration | 10/14 | **PASS** | Close test, record SUCCESS |
| FINN-T Alignment | 11/14 | **PARTIAL** | Decide: accept depth win despite diversity miss? |
| GN Shadow-Tier | 11/14 | **FAILURE** | Decide: extend test + fix GN-S generator, or close FAILED? |
| EC-022 Reward Freeze | 12/30 | **BLOCKED** | Activate IoS-010 Bridge (P5 dependency) |

**All 4 tests have mid_test_reviewed: false. All mid-test checkpoints overdue (Jan 31).**

## EXPERT ANALYSIS: What Would World-Leading Practitioners Do?

### Framework: Renaissance Technologies / AQR / Two Sigma / DeepMind Alpha Approach

The system is at the equivalent of a quantitative research lab that has built extensive infrastructure but hasn't yet closed the loop from hypothesis to capital deployment. Here is what the leading experts in autonomous trading systems, machine learning operations, and quantitative finance would prioritize:

---

### PRIORITY 1: Close the Learning Loop (Week 1) — "The One Thing That Changes Everything"

**Expert consensus (Jim Simons, Marcos Lopez de Prado, David Aronson): You cannot improve what you cannot measure.**

The LVI is at 0.0055 because the loop is broken at the PnL stage. 788 shadow trades sit OPEN with no exit. Without PnL, the system cannot learn which hypotheses generate alpha and which are noise.

**Actions:**
1. **Fix shadow_trade_exit_engine date comparison** — Don't wait for self-correction. Patch line 147 to use `date >= entry_time::date` instead of `date > entry_time`. This unblocks 788 trades immediately instead of waiting 3-5 days.
2. **Process the exit batch** — Run exit engine immediately after fix. 788 OPEN + 1,302 EXPIRED trades = first real PnL dataset.
3. **Feed PnL into LVI** — The learning loop must close: Hypothesis → Experiment → Trade → PnL → Evaluation → LVI update.

**Impact:** LVI could jump from 0.0055 to 0.05+ within 48 hours as completed experiments multiply from 5 to 50+.

---

### PRIORITY 2: Fix the Hypothesis Economy Diversity Problem (Week 1)

**Expert view (Nassim Taleb, Ed Thorp): Concentration in a single generator is the #1 risk to a learning system. Monocultures die.**

`finn_crypto_scheduler` generates 72.5% of all hypotheses. GN-S stopped after Day 1 (2 hypotheses). FINN-E generates depth-1 hypotheses only. The system is effectively running on one idea source.

**Actions:**
1. **Diagnose and restart GN-S generator** — It produced 2 excellent hypotheses (depth 3.5) then stopped. Fix whatever killed it.
2. **Increase FINN-T output** — Currently 222 in 11 days (~20/day). Target: 50/day.
3. **Diversify crypto hypothesis generation** — finn_crypto_scheduler produces volume but low-depth (3.01) single-direction hypotheses. Add at least one contrarian generator.
4. **Activate at least one Tier-2 agent as hypothesis source** — CRIO or CSEO from Phase 2 could add orthogonal idea flow.

**Impact:** Generator diversity from 1 dominant (72.5%) to 3+ balanced (<50%) sources. Directly fixes FINN-T test failure and GN-S test failure.

---

### PRIORITY 3: Activate FSS Computation (Week 1-2) — "Phase 4 is Actually Free"

**Expert view (Andrew Lo, Adaptive Markets): The calibration infrastructure exists but isn't being used. This is the lowest-hanging fruit in the entire system.**

The system has:
- 63,083 forecasts with 99% resolution
- Brier scores per model (STRAT_DAY 0.274, STRAT_WEEK 0.268)
- Skill damper config with 5 tiers
- 15+ calibration tables
- fss_computation_log: **0 entries**

Nobody has ever run the FSS calculator. The entire Phase 4 safety layer is wired but never powered on.

**Actions:**
1. **Build FSS computation daemon** — Similar to lvi_calculator.py. Aggregate Brier scores, compute risk-adjusted skill metric.
2. **Compute first FSS** — Current Brier ~0.32 with 50.8% hit rate = barely above coin flip. FSS will likely be 0.3-0.4 (FREEZE zone). That's fine — it's ground truth.
3. **Wire FSS into skill_damper** — This automatically prevents capital deployment until skill is proven. Phase 4 safety becomes active.

**Impact:** Phase 4 jumps from 5% to 40% complete. The safety layer activates. CEO gets the answer: "Is the system competent enough for real capital?" (Currently: No.)

---

### PRIORITY 4: Activate IoS-008 Decision Engine (Week 2) — "The Brain"

**Expert view (DeepMind / Sutton & Barto RL framework): A system that perceives and learns but cannot decide is not autonomous. The decision function is the missing bridge.**

The system has signals (IoS-001 prices, IoS-003 regimes, IoS-006 macro), it has learning (hypothesis economy, experiments), but it has no decision function. IoS-008 ran 20 shadow evaluations in January then stopped.

**Actions:**
1. **Restart IoS-008 shadow decision cycle** — It has 6 PASS candidates from Jan 13. Re-run with current data.
2. **Process s_tier_promotion_queue** — 8 QUEUED entries from Dec 27, EQS scores 0.95-0.99. Process them.
3. **Produce first DecisionPlan** — Even if rejected by all gates, the act of producing a plan exercises the entire Phase 3 pipeline.
4. **Wire to execution_routing_log** — Even in shadow mode, route decisions for audit trail.

**Impact:** Phase 3 jumps from 10% to 35%. First end-to-end pipeline from perception to (shadow) execution.

---

### PRIORITY 5: The Autonomy Clock Acceleration Strategy (Ongoing)

**Expert view (Demis Hassabis, AlphaFold approach): Autonomous systems must prove reliability through streaks, not spikes.**

Current streak: 1 day. The clock checks:
1. Daemon execution (25/25 active = PASS)
2. No CEO override (PASS)
3. Discrepancy score < 0.10 in last 24h (PASS)

**Actions to protect and grow the streak:**
1. **Monitor tonight's ios001_daily_ingest** — yfinance rate-limiting is the biggest risk to daemon health.
2. **Add redundancy to price ingestion** — If yfinance fails, have fallback (Alpha Vantage, Polygon).
3. **Target: 7-day streak by Feb 12** — This proves system stability.
4. **Target: 30-day streak by March** — This is the autonomy proof for Phase 4 certification.

---

### CRITICAL PATH TO FULL AUTONOMY

```
TODAY (Feb 5):
  Fix shadow_trade_exit → PnL flows → LVI improves
  Fix GN-S generator → diversity improves
  Compute first FSS → safety layer activates

WEEK 1 (Feb 5-12):
  788 shadow trades close → first real PnL dataset
  LVI: 0.0055 → target 0.05 (10x improvement)
  Autonomy streak: 1 → target 7
  Phase 1: 80% → 95%

WEEK 2 (Feb 12-19):
  Activate IoS-008 → first DecisionPlans
  Process s_tier_promotion_queue → paper trade candidates
  First FSS computation → skill measurement begins
  Phase 3: 10% → 35%
  Phase 4: 5% → 40%

MONTH 1 (Feb-Mar):
  First paper trades from autonomous pipeline
  FSS tracking: establish baseline skill
  Autonomy streak: 7 → 30
  Phase 2: 20% → 50% (activate 1-2 Tier-2 agents)

Q1 END (Mar 31):
  Phase 1: 100%
  Phase 2: 50-70%
  Phase 3: 50-70%
  Phase 4: 60-80%
  Autonomy streak: 30+ days
  LVI: target 0.2+ (D grade → C grade)

Q2 (Apr-Jun):
  Phase 4 certification for Live Capital Autonomy (ADR-012)
  FSS > 0.6 required for full sizing
  Autonomy streak: 60+ days
```

---

### THE SINGLE HIGHEST-LEVERAGE ACTION RIGHT NOW

**Fix `shadow_trade_exit_engine.py` line 147.**

One line of code change. It unblocks:
- 788 OPEN shadow trades → PnL data
- PnL data → LVI improvement (10x)
- LVI improvement → learning loop proof
- Learning loop proof → Phase 3 activation justification
- Phase 3 → first DecisionPlans
- DecisionPlans → first paper trades
- Paper trades → FSS computation
- FSS → Phase 4 safety certification

**The entire mastermap bottleneck traces to one date comparison.**

### BRIER SCORE ASSESSMENT: "Is This System Actually Learning?"

| Model | Brier | Hit Rate | Assessment |
|-------|-------|----------|------------|
| STRAT_WEEK_V1 | 0.268 | 40.5% | Below coin flip — LEARNING NEEDED |
| STRAT_DAY_V1 | 0.274 | 50.3% | Coin flip — NEUTRAL |
| STRAT_HOUR_V1 | 0.318 | 60.0% | Slightly above coin flip — EMERGING |
| STRAT_SEC_V1 | 0.325 | 60.2% | Slightly above coin flip — EMERGING |
| GLOBAL | 0.323 | 50.8% | Essentially random — NO SKILL YET |

**Expert assessment (Philip Tetlock, Superforecasting):** A Brier score of 0.25 = perfect uncertainty (coin flip). Scores < 0.25 = skill. Current global 0.323 > 0.25 = worse than random on aggregate. The hourly/second models show marginal edge (0.318-0.325 with 60% hit rate) but day/week models underperform. This is expected at this stage — the system needs more data cycles to calibrate.

**Key insight:** The system is NOT yet skilled. FSS would be in FREEZE zone (< 0.4). This is honest ground truth. The path to skill runs through the learning loop: more closed experiments, better hypothesis selection (Pre-Tier works — G1.5 proved it), and more evaluation cycles.

## CEO P0 DIRECTIVE EXECUTION — 18:00-18:40 CET

**Directive:** Critical Unblocking of Exit Engine & Skill Computation
**Priority:** P0 (IMMEDIATE EXECUTION)
**Orders:** A through E

### Order A: Patch shadow_trade_exit_engine.py — COMPLETE

**Root cause:** Lines 147 and 160 used `AND date > %s` with a timestamptz parameter. PostgreSQL CET timezone causes `date '2026-02-04'` → `2026-02-03T23:00:00Z`, missing the Feb 4 bar entirely.

**Fix applied:**
```python
# Line 147: AND date > (%s)::date
# Line 160: AND date > (%s)::date  AND date <= (%s)::date
```

**Dry-run result:** 536 OPEN trades scanned, 0 closable today (all SPY/XLF entered Feb 4-5, no Feb 5 close bar yet — US markets still open). Fix is ready for tonight's data ingest (~22:00 UTC).

### Order B: Debug & Restart GN-S Generator — COMPLETE

**Root cause:** No scheduler. Was manually run once Jan 24, never again.

**Debug findings:**
1. Golden Needles data input healthy: 45 current, 42 in 30 days
2. Semantic hash dedup was broken: DB trigger `trg_compute_semantic_hash` OVERRIDES Python-computed hash with `compute_hypothesis_hash(origin_rationale, causal_mechanism, direction, event_type_codes)`. Python was checking a hash that was never stored.
3. Additionally, Golden Needle titles change between CEIO runs, further breaking title-based hashes.

**Fix applied:** Compute semantic hash using same formula as DB trigger. Removed unused `semantic_hash` column from INSERT (trigger handles it). Cleaned 83 duplicate hypotheses.

**Results:**
- 6 unique GN-S hypotheses in hypothesis_canon (6 categories: TIMING, REGIME_EDGE, CATALYST_AMPLIFICATION, MEAN_REVERSION, CROSS_ASSET, VOLATILITY)
- Daemon infrastructure added: heartbeat, --once/--interval, file logging, evidence files
- GN-S daemon running continuous (6h cycles), heartbeat HEALTHY

### Order C: Deploy FSS Computation Daemon — COMPLETE

**New file:** `03_FUNCTIONS/fss_computation_daemon.py`

Calls existing SQL function `compute_fss()` (migration 270), logs to `fss_computation_log`, runs `backfill_fss()`.

**Results:**
```
fss_computation_log entries: 1,282 (was 0)
System FSS: -1.23 (avg across 641 assets)
Skill Damper Tier: FREEZE
```

**Interpretation:** System is worse than naive baseline (Brier > 0.25). FSS < 0 means negative skill. This is honest ground truth. All capital remains locked per skill damper.

**Bonus fix:** Fixed `backfill_fss()` SQL function type cast bug (`CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '90 days'` → `::DATE` cast).

FSS daemon running continuous (6h cycles), heartbeat HEALTHY.

### Order D: Restart IoS-008 Decision Engine — COMPLETE

Ran `shadow_decision_evaluator.py` (CEO-DIR-2026-050):
- 20 signals evaluated through LIDS gates
- 0 passed (all blocked by LIDS_FRESHNESS: data 200-715h stale)
- Root cause: `price_witness_timestamp` on Golden Needles hasn't been refreshed by CEIO
- LIDS gates working correctly — freshness is the bottleneck, not code

Shadow decision evaluator running continuous (1h cycles), heartbeat HEALTHY.

### Order E: Protect Autonomy Streak — COMPLETE

```sql
-- Autonomy clock ticked: Day 1 → Day 2
SELECT state, consecutive_days FROM fhq_governance.autonomy_clock_state;
-- state=RUNNING, consecutive_days=2
```

All 3 conditions passed:
1. Daemon execution: PASS
2. No CEO override: PASS
3. Discrepancy ≤ 0.1: PASS

**Target: 7 consecutive days by Feb 12. Current: Day 2. On track.**

### New Daemons Deployed This Session

| Daemon | Status | Interval | Task |
|--------|--------|----------|------|
| gn_s_shadow_generator | HEALTHY | 6h | Hypothesis diversity |
| fss_computation_daemon | HEALTHY | 6h | Skill score computation |
| shadow_decision_evaluator | HEALTHY | 1h | LIDS gate evaluation |

### CEO Success Criteria Assessment (Day 37)

| Criterion | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| 788 trades evaluated with PnL | PENDING | Fix applied, awaiting Feb 5 close data (~22:00 UTC) |
| FSS computed and visible | DONE | FSS = -1.23 (FREEZE), 641 assets, 1,282 log entries |
| GN-S producing hypotheses | DONE | 6 hypotheses across 6 categories, daemon running |
| IoS-008 processing candidates | DONE | 20 evaluated, 0 passed (data freshness bottleneck) |
| Autonomy clock at 2 days | DONE | Ticked to Day 2 |

### 18:50 CET — ios001_daily_ingest Scheduler Registration

**Issue:** ios001_daily_ingest was NOT registered in Windows Task Scheduler. Despite heartbeating HEALTHY in daemon_health, no scheduled task existed. The manual ingest at 18:40 CET was triggered ad-hoc, and tonight's critical equity ingest (23:00 CET) would NOT have fired automatically.

**Fix:** Registered 3 scheduled tasks via PowerShell `Register-ScheduledTask`:

| Task Name | Schedule | Action |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| `FHQ_IOS001_CRYPTO` | Daily 02:00 CET | `python ios001_daily_ingest.py --asset-class CRYPTO` |
| `FHQ_IOS001_EQUITY` | Mon-Fri 23:00 CET | `python ios001_daily_ingest.py --asset-class EQUITY` |
| `FHQ_IOS001_FX` | Sun-Thu 23:00 CET | `python ios001_daily_ingest.py --asset-class FX` |

**Verification:**

```
FHQ_IOS001_CRYPTO | State=Ready | NextRun=2026-02-06 02:00
FHQ_IOS001_EQUITY | State=Ready | NextRun=2026-02-05 23:00  ← TONIGHT
FHQ_IOS001_FX     | State=Ready | NextRun=2026-02-05 23:00  ← TONIGHT
```

**Python path:** Uses short path `C:\Users\RJANSK~1\` (resolves `Ørjan Skjold` without encoding issues).

**Critical path confirmed:** Tonight at 23:00 CET, `FHQ_IOS001_EQUITY` ingests Feb 5 closing prices for 421 equity assets. `shadow_trade_exit_engine` (scheduled every ~15min) will then process Feb 5 bars and generate first PnL for 536+ open shadow trades.

---

### 19:30-20:00 CET — CEO P0: Silent Operations & Singleton Discipline

**Directive:** Eliminate PowerShell popups, remove duplicate/zombie processes, restore single-writer discipline.

#### Phase A: Process Cleanup — COMPLETE

5 duplicate legacy PIDs killed:

| PID | Daemon | Started | Status |
|-----|--------|---------|--------|
| 23424 | finn_brain_scheduler | Feb 2 08:35 | KILLED |
| 19088 | finn_e_scheduler | Feb 2 08:38 | KILLED |
| 20012 | finn_t_scheduler | Feb 2 08:38 | KILLED |
| 14400 | finn_crypto_scheduler | Feb 2 08:38 | KILLED |
| 24460 | mechanism_alpha_trigger | Feb 4 23:24 | KILLED |

2 zombie PIDs (6968, 6984 from Feb 1) require admin elevation — inert, no cmdline.

**After:** All 5 daemons at exactly 1 instance.

#### Phase B: PowerShell Window Suppression — COMPLETE

Added `-WindowStyle Hidden` to all 9 PS1-based Task Scheduler tasks:

- FHQ_BROKER_STATE_RECONCILIATION (PT5M)
- FHQ_MECHANISM_ALPHA_TRIGGER (PT15M)
- FHQ_SHADOW_TRADE_CREATOR (PT15M)
- FHQ_SHADOW_TRADE_EXIT_ENGINE (PT15M)
- FHQ_CAPITAL_SIMULATION_WRITER (PT1H)
- FHQ_DECISION_PACK_GENERATOR (PT1H)
- FHQ_MECHANISM_ALPHA_OUTCOME (PT1H)
- FHQ_PROMOTION_GATE_PULSE (PT1H)
- FHQ_SHADOW_TIER_BRIDGE (PT1H)

**9/9 PASS verification.**

#### Phase C: Single-Writer Discipline — COMPLETE

**C1: Task Scheduler guard** — `MultipleInstances=IgnoreNew` on 27/27 FHQ tasks.

**C2: PID lock file utility** — New `daemon_lock.py` with acquire/release. Added to 5 daemons:
- finn_brain_scheduler, finn_e_scheduler, finn_t_scheduler, finn_crypto_scheduler, mechanism_alpha_trigger
- Test: acquire→True, duplicate→False (SINGLETON BLOCK), release+reacquire→True. PASS.

**DB write safety proof:** All 5 daemons have exactly 1 row in daemon_health. Single-writer confirmed.

**Evidence:** `03_FUNCTIONS/evidence/SINGLETON_REMEDIATION_20260205.json`

---

### 20:10 CET — Telegram Notification System Audit & Meta-Analysis

**Scope:** Full database verification of Telegram notification infrastructure, price staleness monitoring, morning report, and expert meta-analysis.

#### Files Analyzed (6 core Telegram files)

| File | Purpose | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| `telegram_notifier.py` | Core alert broadcaster (5 alert types) | CODE READY, alerts disabled |
| `ceo_telegram_gateway.py` | Bidirectional CEO command interface (14 cmds) | CODE READY, not deployed |
| `ceo_gateway_daemon.py` | Telegram polling daemon | NOT RUNNING |
| `telegram_narrative_service.py` | Signal storytelling engine | NEVER ACTIVATED |
| `price_freshness_heartbeat.py` | Price staleness monitor | RUNNING (15 evidence files today) |
| `phase2_morning_verification.py` | Daily health report (08:30) | RUNS, no audit trail |

#### Database Findings

**alert_config:** ALL 4 ALERTS DISABLED

| alert_type | enabled | threshold |
|------------|---------|-----------|
| PRICE_STALE_CRITICAL | false | 12h crypto / 48h equity |
| DAEMON_HEALTH_CRITICAL | false | 2 consecutive failures |
| HYPOTHESIS_DEATH_SPIKE | false | 10 deaths/hour |
| AUTONOMY_CLOCK_BREAK | false | streak break |

**Price staleness (20:10 CET):**
- CRYPTO: BTC/ETH/SOL ~19h stale (BLACKOUT — market open, ingest at 02:00)
- EQUITY: SPY/XLF etc — data from Feb 4 close (expected, Feb 5 close pending tonight 23:00)
- FX: EURUSD 43h stale (HEALTHY — within 60h threshold)
- Only 4 assets monitored out of 499 total

**Morning verification:** Runs at 08:30, sends Telegram report. No `run_ledger` entries (no audit trail).

**Price freshness heartbeat:** Runs every ~90min. Alerts suppressed by dedup logic (sends once per status change, no escalation timer for persistent degradation).

#### Expert Meta-Analysis: 6 Critical Gaps Identified

1. **All alerts disabled** — System cannot notify CEO of any critical event
2. **Only 4/499 assets monitored** — 99.2% of price universe unmonitored
3. **No escalation timer** — Persistent BLACKOUT never escalates beyond first (suppressed) alert
4. **CEO gateway not deployed** — Bidirectional command interface exists but never started
5. **Narrative service never wired** — Signal storytelling code complete but unused
6. **No morning report audit trail** — No way to verify if morning reports actually sent

#### 5 Highest-Leverage Fixes (Recommended)

1. Enable 4 `alert_config` entries (1 SQL UPDATE)
2. Add equity/crypto top-20 assets to price freshness monitoring
3. Add LVI/FSS/shadow PnL metrics to morning report
4. Add `run_ledger` logging to morning verification
5. Add escalation timer to dedup logic (re-alert after 6h persistent degradation)

**Status: Audit complete. Fixes await CEO directive.**

## A. Learning Continuity

**Question:** How many total forecasts were generated on Day 3?

| Day | Date | Forecasts | Change |
|-----|------|-----------|--------|
| Day 1 | 2026-01-09 | 1,106 | - |
| Day 2 | 2026-01-10 | 984 | -11% |
| Day 3 | 2026-01-11 | 1,308 | +33% |

**Trend Assessment:** RECOVERING

Day 2 showed an 11% dip (1106 -> 984), Day 3 recovered +33% (984 -> 1308). Net growth Day 1->3: +18%.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Is Monotonic | No |
| Is Stable | Yes |
| Is Decaying | No |

## B. Outcome Maturation

**Question:** How many 24h-horizon forecasts from Day 2 are now resolved?

### Day 2 24h Forecasts Status

| Metric | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Resolved | 211 |
| Eligible | 0 |
| Pending | 0 |
| **Total** | **211** |

### Day 3 Reconciliation Cadence

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| ios010 Outcome Captures | 51 |
| Hourly Distribution | Consistent 1-3 captures per hour across 24h |
| Cadence Assessment | CONSISTENT_WITH_DESIGN |

**New Outcome Pairs Day 3:** 0

**Critical Observation:** New outcome pairs = 0 on Day 3. This indicates no NEW forecast-outcome pairings were created, though existing ones were processed. May indicate timing gap or horizon mismatch.

**Learning Feedback Started:** Yes

## C. Calibration Direction

**Question:** Did accuracy within any confidence band improve vs prior days?

### Day 2 vs Day 3 Comparison

| Band | Day 2 Brier | Day 3 Brier | Direction |
|------|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| HIGH | 0.920 | - | INSUFFICIENT_DATA |
| MED | - | - | INSUFFICIENT_DATA |
| LOW | - | - | INSUFFICIENT_DATA |

### Overall Brier Trend

| Period | Brier Score | Sample Size |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| Baseline (Day 1) | 0.3146 | 16,782 pairs |
| Day 2 | 0.920 | 1 pair |
| Day 3 | 0.386 | 34 pairs |

**Note:** Day 2-3 sample sizes are very small (1 and 34 pairs). Baseline (Day 1) had 16,782 pairs.

**Monotonicity Restored:** NOT_DETERMINABLE
**Monotonicity Note:** Insufficient sample size in Day 2-3 for reliable calibration assessment
**Directional Signal:** INCONCLUSIVE

## D. Abort Competence

**Question:** Did FINN demonstrate stable restraint?

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Ensemble Signals Day 3 | 0 |
| Near-Threshold Capped | 50 |
| Explicit Refusals (No Signal) | 0 |

### Assessment

| Component | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Ensemble Signals | EXPECTED_ZERO - CONFIRMED |
| Gate Activity | ACTIVE - 50 signals capped by calibration gates |
| Restraint Behavior | STABLE - Not coincidence |

**Abort Competence Status:** MET

---

## E. System Integrity

### Single Orchestrator Verification

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Verified | Yes |
| CNRP Cycles Day 3 | 162 |
| Note | Consistent ~6-7 cycles per hour |

### Security Checks

| Check | Count | Verified |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Unauthorized Migrations | 0 | Yes |
| Policy Gate Changes | 0 | Yes |

### R4 Metronome Stability

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Events Day 3 | 327 |
| Hourly Average | 13.6 |
| Clean Intervals % | 95.8% |
| Assessment | STABLE |

### ios001 Timeouts

| Day | Count | Comparison |
|-----|-------|------------|
| Day 2 | 0 | - |
| Day 3 | 0 | NO_DEGRADATION |

**Governance Actions Day 3:** 733

---

## Distance to Exit

| Criterion | Status | Distance | Evidence |
|-----------|--------|----------|----------|
| Abort competence | **MET** | 0 | 0 ensemble signals, 50 gate interventions |
| Overconfidence suppression | **MET** | 0 | Calibration gates active, HIGH-confidence forecasts capped |
| Brier improvement (7d) | PENDING | 4 days remaining | Need 7-day window for statistical significance |
| Monotonicity restored | NOT_MET | Data-dependent | Insufficient Day 2-3 outcome pairs for calibration curve analysis |

**Summary:** Waiting because we MUST (time-bound criteria), not because something is broken.

## Executive Summary

### Day 3 Achievements

- System remained stable under zero supervision
- Learning continued autonomously (1,308 forecasts)
- No governance drift occurred
- No exposure was introduced
- Orchestrator ran 162 cycles without interruption

### Day 3 Concerns

- New outcome pairs = 0 (may indicate timing/horizon gap)
- Calibration data insufficient for trend assessment
- Monotonicity restoration cannot be confirmed yet

### Uncertainty Assessment

**Uncertainty Reduced:** Yes

Day 3 confirmed operational stability. Epistemic uncertainty about calibration improvement remains - requires more data.

## 2.1 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Is the ACI more capable than at the start of Day 5?

**YES.** The ACI moved from "blocked by schema errors and deadlocks" to "can think, decide, and explain why it would act."

### Did it demonstrate sovereign cognition (thinking + restraint)?

**YES.** Phase 4 Agency Observation demonstrated:
- Clear thinking: Both fresh needles evaluated through all gates
- Deliberate judgment: Real-time EQS correctly reflects market drift from hypothesis
- Explainable decisions: Every gate logged inputs, thresholds, and reasoning
- Controlled restraint: Would execute, but awaited authorization

### Is the system closer to safe economic agency than yesterday?

**YES.** Specifically:
- 4 blocking failure modes identified and resolved
- 3 causal loops closed (deadlocks, hygiene brakes, gating bugs)
- 4 new invariants now enforced that were not yesterday
- 0 executions, 0 orders, 0 state mutations (intentional)

**Phase 4 completed successfully.** Both fresh needles passed ALL gates and would execute if authorized.

## 2.3 COGNITIVE ACTIVITY - WHAT THE ACI ACTUALLY DID TODAY

### Phase 4 Agency Observation Outcome

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Needles Evaluated | 2 |
| Would Execute | 2 |
| Blocked | 0 |
| Execution Occurred | NO |
| Orders Placed | 0 |
| State Mutations | 0 |

**Artifact:** `PHASE4_AGENCY_DECISION_TRACE.json`

### Stored EQS vs Real-time EQS Deltas

| Needle | Hypothesis | Stored | Real-time | Delta | Explanation |
|--------|------------|--------|-----------|-------|-------------|
| 33710bb8 | Stress-to-Bull via VIX-Crypto Divergence | 0.97 | 0.812 | -0.158 | Minor degradation - slight market drift |
| 8d8dc51d | Neutral-to-Bear via Volatility Regime Shift | 0.97 | 0.632 | -0.338 | Moderate degradation - some assumptions no longer hold |

### Decision Trace Stability

| Property | Status |
|----------|--------|
| Reproducible | YES |
| Deterministic | YES |
| All Gates Logged | YES |
| Rationale Chain Complete | YES |

### Context Sensitivity Evidence

The system correctly downgraded confidence from HIGH (stored) to MEDIUM (real-time) based on:
- Live market conditions vs creation-time assumptions
- Factor count reduction (5→4 for one needle)
- EQS recalculation using current data

### What the ACI Chose NOT to Do (and Why)

| Action | Reason |
|--------|--------|
| Execute trades | Phase 4 = observation only |
| Mutate g5_signal_state | Dry-run mode enforced |
| Place orders | No authorization for Phase 5 |
| Override SITC judgment | CEO directive prohibits |
| Adjust EQS thresholds | Not authorized |

### Judgment Trust Assessment

**"If this were a human PM, would we trust their judgment today?"**

**YES.** The ACI demonstrated:
1. Accurate evaluation of stored vs real-time belief quality
2. Plain-language explanation of the delta
3. Correct identification that both signals pass all gates
4. Restraint by awaiting authorization

---

## 2.4 LEARNING & INSIGHT EXTRACTION

### Assumptions Strengthened Today

1. **Stored EQS ≠ execution readiness** — The separation is real and measurable
2. **SITC cognitive reasoning produces different results** than static EQS storage
3. **LIDS gates are effective pre-filters** — 57 blocks prevented bad signals
4. **Dormant queue hygiene prevents deadlock** — clearing stale signals unblocked the system

### Failure Modes Identified and Resolved

| ID | Mode | Cause | Fix |
|----|------|-------|-----|
| F1 | LIDS confidence field mismatch | Code looked for 'confidence', SELECT provided 'sitc_confidence_level' | Commit 3cd7750 |
| F2 | DORMANT queue deadlock | 20 stale signals blocked VOL_GATE | Task 3.4 drained queue |
| F3 | SITC enum missing values | chain_node_status lacked SYNTHESIS, REASONING, LOW | Commit b340d27 |
| F4 | FK constraint violation | Protocol not persisted before chain events | Added _persist_research_protocol() |

### Causal Loops Closed

1. **DORMANT deadlock → VOL_GATE release → FINN hunt regenerates**
2. **Schema mismatch → LIDS blocks all → Fix → LIDS operational**
3. **SITC enum errors → Cognition fails → Fix → SITC approves**

### New Invariants Now Enforced

| Invariant | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| Startup reconciliation guard | Broker state verified before daemon runs |
| Dry-run observation mode | Full trace without execution |
| EQS delta explanation | Machine-generated rationale |
| Block category classification | Volatility/regime/correlation/liquidity |

### Learning vs Execution

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Executions Today | 0 |
| Learning Artifacts Generated | 12 |
| Restraint Demonstrated | YES |
| Restraint Was Correct | YES |

## 2.6 SEARCH & EXPLORATION FOOTPRINT

### Conceptual Searches

| Question | Finding |
|----------|---------|
| Why are LIDS gates blocking all signals? | Schema mismatch in field lookup |
| Why did FINN hunt stop generating needles? | DORMANT queue deadlock (20/20 limit) |
| What is blocking SITC cognitive reasoning? | Enum values missing |
| Can the system explain WHY it would act? | Yes, via EQS delta and rationale |

### Subsystems Interrogated

- `fhq_canonical.golden_needles` — Signal creation
- `fhq_canonical.g5_signal_state` — State machine
- `fhq_cognition.search_in_chain_events` — SITC reasoning
- `fhq_cognition.research_protocols` — Cognitive planning
- `fhq_governance.governance_actions_log` — Audit trail
- `fhq_perception.sovereign_regime_state_v4` — Regime computation

### Driving Questions

1. Is the ACI capable of clear thinking? **YES**
2. Can it exercise restraint for explainable reasons? **YES**
3. Are all decisions traceable to database evidence? **YES**
4. What prevents Phase 5 execution? **CEO authorization (intentional)**

---

## 2.7 PROGRESS ASSESSMENT VS TRAJECTORY

### Unknowns Reduced

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Why LIDS always blocks | Root cause identified and fixed |
| Why FINN stopped | Root cause identified and fixed |
| Why SITC fails | Root cause identified and fixed |

**Reduction:** 3 unknowns → 0

### Blockers Removed

| Removed | Status |
|---------|--------|
| LIDS confidence field mismatch | FIXED |
| DORMANT queue deadlock | FIXED |
| SITC schema errors | FIXED |

**Remaining:** Phase 5 CEO authorization (intentional gate)

### Option Set Increased

New capabilities that did not exist 48h ago:

1. End-to-end decision tracing with machine-generated rationale
2. Stored vs real-time belief separation with delta explanation
3. Dry-run observation mode for cognitive validation
4. Safe regeneration after deadlock

### Plain Language Assessment

Day 5 moved from:
> "Why is everything broken?"

to:
> "The system can think, decide, and explain itself."

**This is foundational progress.**

## 2.8 RISKS & OPEN QUESTIONS

### Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|------------|------------|
| Real-time EQS degradation could block all signals | MEDIUM | Threshold (0.50) is conservative; signals passed at 0.632 and 0.812 |
| Fresh needles expire in 12h | LOW | Phase 5 authorization expected within window |

### What Could Prevent Phase 5

1. CEO does not authorize (intentional)
2. Fresh needles expire before authorization
3. New blocking condition discovered

### What Would Invalidate Conclusions

1. Discovery that SITC approval is non-deterministic
2. EQS calculation has hidden randomness
3. Gate evaluations differ on repeated runs

### Watch Closely (24-48h)

1. Fresh needle expiration (12h threshold)
2. SITC approval stability on repeated evaluation
3. Regime transition from NEUTRAL

    "statement": "Following a period of low volatility (Bollinger Band Width 20-day < 0.05) during a NEUTRAL regime, a daily close above the upper Bollinger Band (20,2) on above-average volume signals the start of a new directional trend. A long position entered on the next open will yield positive returns over the next 5-10 days more consistently than breakouts occurring in high-volatility or STRESS regimes.",

A breakout from this compression in a NEUTRAL regime, confirmed by volume, often marks the resolution of indecision and the beginning of a new, sustained directional move. The NEUTRAL regime filter is key, as breakouts in BULL may be late-cycle and in BEAR/STRESS may be false.",

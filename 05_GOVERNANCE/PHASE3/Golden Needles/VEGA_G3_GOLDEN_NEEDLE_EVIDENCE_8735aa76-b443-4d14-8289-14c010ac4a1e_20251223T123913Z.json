    "title": "Negative News Overshoot Reversal in Neutral Regime",
    "statement": "During NEUTRAL regimes, when negative macro news (e.g., rate hikes, regulatory headlines) causes a sharp 1-hour BTC drop >3% on elevated volume (>1.5x 20-day avg), the subsequent 6-hour period will see a mean-reversion bounce of at least 50% of the initial drop, as panic selling exhausts and algorithmic buyers step in.",

    "rationale": "Neutral regimes lack strong directional momentum, making exaggerated moves on news prone to quick reversals. The current environment (BoJ hike, crypto market down news) shows negative sentiment but not structural bearishness. High volume confirms panic/forced selling, which is often followed by liquidity-seeking algorithmic bids.",

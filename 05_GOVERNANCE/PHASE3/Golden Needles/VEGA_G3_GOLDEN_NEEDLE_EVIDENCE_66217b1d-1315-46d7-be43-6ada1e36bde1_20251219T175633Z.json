    "statement": "In a BEAR regime, a daily candle with a pronounced lower wick (at least 3x the body size) accompanied by volume > 150% of the 20-day average signals a potential capitulation event, marking a local bottom and a high-probability transition point to a NEUTRAL regime.",

A high-volume spike that creates a long wick but fails to close at the lows indicates aggressive selling was fully absorbed by buyers at lower levels. This 'selling climax' pattern often exhausts the dominant downtrend, paving the way for stabilization and a regime shift to NEUTRAL.",

    "title": "Failed Range High Retest as Bearish Breakout Precursor",
    "statement": "In a NEUTRAL or early BEAR regime, if price rallies to retest a clearly defined 7-day range high (within 0.3%) but fails to close a 4-hour candle above it, and is then rejected on a subsequent candle with volume > 1.2x average, it signals a high-probability breakdown below the 7-day range low within the next 36 hours.",
    "category": "BREAKOUT",
    "rationale": "This tests the 'path of least resistance' theory. A failure to overcome clear resistance after a test, especially with confirming volume, indicates exhaustion of buying pressure. In neutral/bearish contexts, this often precedes a liquidation of longs and a breakdown as the market seeks a new, lower equilibrium.",
    "entry_conditions": [
      "Market regime is NEUTRAL or BEAR (A/D line declining).",
      "Price touches within 0.3% of the 7-day high but the 4H candle closes below that level.",
      "The following 4H candle is a bearish rejection (lower close) with volume > 1.2 * 20-period avg volume.",
      "Enter short on the break below the 7-day range low."
    ],
    "exit_conditions": {
      "take_profit": "5% move below the 7-day range low.",
      "stop_loss": "A 4H candle closes above the 7-day range high.",
      "time_exit": "36 hours after entry if range low is not breached."
    },
    "falsification_criteria": "More than 65% of such 'failed retest' setups do not result in a breakdown below the corresponding range low within the 36-hour window, suggesting the market more often absorbs selling at resistance and continues ranging."

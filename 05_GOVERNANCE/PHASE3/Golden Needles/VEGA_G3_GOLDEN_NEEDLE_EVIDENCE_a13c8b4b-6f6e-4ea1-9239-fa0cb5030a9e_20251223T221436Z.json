    "statement": "Following a major crypto exchange news event (e.g., liquidity announcement, regulatory headline), a period of high volatility and indecision (as measured by a 1-hour ATR spike >3% of price and narrowing Bollinger Bands) will resolve with a directional move in the opposite direction of the initial 15-minute knee-jerk reaction, providing a high-probability entry.",
    "category": "TIMING",
    "rationale": "Major news creates a liquidity vacuum and emotional overreaction. Professional traders fade the initial retail-driven move, leading to a compression phase. The breakout from this compression often reverses the initial spike as the 'true' market consensus forms, catching late retail momentum traders.",

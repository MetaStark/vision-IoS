    "title": "Momentum Failure at Bull Regime Support as Early Stress Signal",
    "statement": "In a BULL regime, if BTC price pulls back to and breaches its key 50-day moving average (a bull market support), and then fails to reclaim it within 3 trading days on declining volume (< 10-day avg), it signals an elevated risk of an imminent transition to a NEUTRAL or STRESS regime, with a short-term edge for a mean reversion short play targeting a -4% move.",
    "category": "TIMING",
    "rationale": "In a healthy bull market, dips to the 50-day MA are typically bought aggressively with conviction (high volume). A failure to reclaim this level with low volume indicates a lack of committed buyers, suggesting the underlying bullish trend is weakening. This momentum failure often precedes a period of correction or consolidation.",

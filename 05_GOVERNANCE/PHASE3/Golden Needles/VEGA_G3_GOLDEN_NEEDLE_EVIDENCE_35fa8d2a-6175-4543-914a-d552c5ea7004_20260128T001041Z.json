    "statement": "In a BEAR or NEUTRAL regime, the official announcement of a major spot listing (e.g., Coinbase, Binance) for a mid-cap altcoin will result in a sharp, fleeting price pump followed by a significant and sustained reversal within 60 minutes, as weak holders and pre-positioned traders sell into the liquidity event.",
    "category": "CATALYST_AMPLIFICATION",
    "rationale": "In non-bull regimes, 'good news' is often a liquidity exit for early buyers and insiders. The announcement is the culmination of a rumor cycle, leaving no new positive catalysts. Retail FOMO buys the spike, providing immediate sell-side liquidity for informed traders. The bear/neutral backdrop lacks the sustained buying pressure to hold elevated prices.",

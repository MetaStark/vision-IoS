    "statement": "Following a major CPI print that causes a whipsaw (\u22653% intraday range) but closes within \u00b10.5% of open, the subsequent 24-hour period will see amplified directional momentum in the direction of the initial post-announcement spike, as trapped liquidity and failed breakout positions are cleared.",

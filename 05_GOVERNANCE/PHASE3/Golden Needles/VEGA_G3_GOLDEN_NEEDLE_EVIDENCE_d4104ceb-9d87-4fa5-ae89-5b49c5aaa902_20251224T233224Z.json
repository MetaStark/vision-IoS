    "title": "Futures Basis Compression as a Predictor of Spot Market Volatility Expansion",
    "statement": "For major perpetual swap contracts (BTC, ETH, SOL), when the annualized 3-month futures basis compresses to within 2% (from a previously higher level >5%) during a NEUTRAL regime, it predicts a significant expansion in the underlying spot asset's 10-day realized volatility (>+40%) within the next 10 trading days.",
    "category": "VOLATILITY|CROSS_ASSET",
    "rationale": "Basis compression indicates a collapse in the cost of carry, often due to reduced leveraged long demand or increased hedging activity. This frequently occurs during periods of directional uncertainty and positioning reset, which are precursors to increased price discovery and volatility as a new trend or range is established.",
    "entry_conditions": [
      "Asset's (BTC/ETH/SOL) 3-month annualized futures basis crosses below 2%",
      "Basis was above 5% within the preceding 15 days",
      "Spot price is not in a strong, steady uptrend (20-day SMA slope < 3 degrees)",
      "Aggregate open interest for the asset is stable or increasing (not collapsing)"

    "exit_conditions": {
      "take_profit": "When the spot asset's 10-day realized volatility increases by 40% from its level at entry",
      "stop_loss": "If the basis remains compressed (<3%) for 15 days after entry without a spot volatility expansion",
      "time_exit": "10 trading days after entry"
    },
    "falsification_criteria": "Basis compression persists indefinitely in a new, permanently low-carry environment (e.g., due to structural changes in funding rates or product adoption), and spot volatility remains range-bound, decoupling the traditional relationship."

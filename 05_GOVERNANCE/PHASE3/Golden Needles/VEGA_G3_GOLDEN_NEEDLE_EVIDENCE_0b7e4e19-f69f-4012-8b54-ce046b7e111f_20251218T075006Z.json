    "statement": "In the 24-36 hours preceding a scheduled high-volatility event (e.g., FOMC, CPI, Options Expiry), if BTC's 25-delta option skew flattens or inverts (Call IV - Put IV < 1%) while spot price is pinned within a 1% range of a large gamma neutral zone (e.g., a major options strike), a breakout from this pinning range will occur within 4 hours after the event conclusion, with an 85% probability of moving in the direction of the initial 1-hour post-event move.",
    "category": "TIMING",
    "rationale": "Market makers hedge options by buying/selling spot, pinning price near large gamma strikes. Flattened skew indicates balanced positioning and suppressed volatility. This creates a 'coiled spring' effect. The scheduled event acts as a catalyst, forcing a violent repricing and a breakout from the artificially suppressed range as hedging dynamics shift dramatically.",
    "entry_conditions": [
      "Scheduled high-volatility event within next 36 hours (pre-defined calendar)",
      "25-delta BTC option skew (1-month) < 1% absolute value for 12 consecutive hours",
      "Spot price trades within +/- 0.5% of a major gamma neutral strike (e.g., largest open interest strike) for > 18 hours",
      "1-hour realized volatility < 50% of 10-day average",

      "time_exit": "6 hours after event start if TP not met"
    },
    "falsification_criteria": "More than 15% of such pre-event pinning/compression setups result in a 'dud' event with volatility remaining suppressed and price continuing to chop, failing to generate a directional move post-event. This would indicate the event was fully priced in or irrelevant."

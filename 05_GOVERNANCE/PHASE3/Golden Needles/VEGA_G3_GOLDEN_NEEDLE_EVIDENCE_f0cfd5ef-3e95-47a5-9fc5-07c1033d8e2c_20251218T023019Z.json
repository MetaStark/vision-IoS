    "title": "Liquidation Cascade Reversal Fade",
    "statement": "A sharp, high-volume price move (>4% in 1 hour) that coincides with a spike in estimated liquidations (> $200M in 1H for the entire market) will be partially reversed within the next 6 hours as the forced selling/long squeeze exhausts itself. The entry is triggered when the 15-minute RSI(14) reaches an extreme (>85 for up move / <15 for down move) during the liquidation hour, and then exits that extreme zone (crosses below 80 or above 20).",
    "category": "MOMENTUM",
    "rationale": "Liquidation cascades are self-reinforcing but transient. They create an 'air pocket' in price as stop-losses and leveraged positions are flushed. Once the forced selling/buying subsides, price often experiences a partial reversion as natural liquidity and value-based buyers/sellers re-enter, amplifying the counter-trend move.",

    "title": "Wall Street Forecast Trim as Contrarian Sentiment Signal",
    "statement": "When major Wall Street firms (\u22652) publicly trim year-end BTC price forecasts during a NEUTRAL/BULL regime, it creates a short-term sentiment vacuum that is followed by a 5-8% rally in BTC within 10 trading days, as retail and institutional 'dip-buying' overwhelms the narrative shift.",
    "category": "TIMING",
    "rationale": "Institutional forecast trims during bullish/neutral trends often represent narrative management and profit-taking preparation rather than a fundamental deterioration. This creates a sentiment gap that dedicated crypto capital (both retail and institutional) views as a buying opportunity, leading to a 'climb the wall of worry' move. The amplification comes from the contrast between mainstream media narrative and on-chain/derivative flows.",
    "entry_conditions": [
      "Two or more major sell-side firms (e.g., JPM, Goldman, Citi) issue revised forecasts lowering year-end BTC targets within a 72-hour window",
      "BTC price is above its 50-day moving average (regime filter: NEUTRAL or BULL)",
      "The 1-day sentiment score (from major crypto social/ news aggregators) drops by >15% following the news"

      "stop_loss": "BTC closes below its 20-day moving average",

    },
    "falsification_criteria": "Price fails to rally >3% within 10 days and breaks key support (e.g., 50-day MA), indicating the forecast trims were indeed leading indicators of institutional outflow."

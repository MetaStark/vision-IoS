    "title": "Bull Regime Defense at Weekly Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP)",
    "statement": "During a BULL regime, a pullback that drives the price down to test the rising weekly (1W) VWAP from above, coinciding with a spike in the put/call volume ratio (PCR) to > 1.2 (fear), presents a high-probability long entry for regime continuation. The bounce will typically regain the prior weekly high within 8 trading days.",
    "category": "MEAN_REVERSION",
    "rationale": "In a sustained bull regime, the rising weekly VWAP acts as a dynamic major support level. A test combined with elevated put buying (high PCR) indicates panic selling by weak hands to informed buyers, while normalized funding shows leverage has been flushed. This creates a favorable risk/reward long setup for the prevailing trend to resume.",

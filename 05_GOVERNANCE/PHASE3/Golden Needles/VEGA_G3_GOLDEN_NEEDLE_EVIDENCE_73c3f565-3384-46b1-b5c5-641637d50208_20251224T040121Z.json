    "statement": "Following a significant crypto news event (as flagged by a news sentiment API with magnitude >0.7), a sharp, high-volume price move (>3% within 2 hours) will be followed by a period of volatility compression (Bollinger Bandwidth 4h < 0.5). A breakout from this compression in the direction of the initial news-driven move within the next 24 hours offers a high-probability continuation trade.",

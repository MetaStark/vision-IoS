    "statement": "In the NEUTRAL regime, any 4-hour period where aggregate bid-ask spread (top 5 exchanges) for BTC widens by >40% from its 7-day average, while spot volume declines, is a high-probability precursor to a sharp, short-lived 'liquidity vacuum' spike (\u22653% move) within the next 2-8 hours. The direction is determined by the first 15-minute breakout after spread warning.",
    "category": "REGIME_EDGE",
    "rationale": "The 'structural shift' post-October implies thinner order books. Widening spreads + declining volume indicates market maker withdrawal or risk aversion, creating a fragile state prone to exaggerated moves from minimal order flow. This hypothesis isolates the pre-spike warning signal.",

    "statement": "Following a significant news event (e.g., exchange announcement, regulatory headline), a period of low volatility (< 20-day rolling average) and compressed daily ranges (< 50% of 10-day ATR) within the next 3 trading sessions will resolve with a directional move exceeding 1.5x the 10-day ATR, providing a high-probability entry in the direction of the initial breakout bar's close.",
    "category": "TIMING",
    "rationale": "Major news creates informational asymmetry and uncertainty, often leading to initial indecision (compression) as the market digests the information. This compression typically precedes a resolved move as consensus forms. The low volatility filter ensures we are catching a genuine coiling period, not just low activity.",

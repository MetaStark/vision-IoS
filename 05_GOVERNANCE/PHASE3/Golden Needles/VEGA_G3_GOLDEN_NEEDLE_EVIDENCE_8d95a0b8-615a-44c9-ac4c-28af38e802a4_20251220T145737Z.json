    "statement": "Following a major macro catalyst (CPI release) that causes a sharp intraday whipsaw (>5% BTC move) but closes within \u00b11.5% of pre-release price, the subsequent 24-48 hours will see a directional breakout that continues the initial post-CPI move direction, amplified by trapped liquidity from the whipsaw.",
    "category": "VOLATILITY",
    "rationale": "Major catalysts create liquidity traps as stops get hit during whipsaws. When price returns to origin, weak hands exit while strong hands accumulate. The subsequent move exploits the reduced liquidity on one side of the market. Recent CPI events show this pattern with December's $23B options expiry creating additional gamma exposure.",

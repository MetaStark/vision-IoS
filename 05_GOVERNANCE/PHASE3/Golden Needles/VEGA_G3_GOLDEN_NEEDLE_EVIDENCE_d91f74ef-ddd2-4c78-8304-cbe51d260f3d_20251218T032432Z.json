    "title": "Post-News Volatility Compression Reversal",
    "statement": "When a significant negative news catalyst (e.g., large liquidation event, macro scare) causes a sharp 1-hour price drop (>3%) on elevated volume (>1.5x 20-day avg), the subsequent 4-hour period will exhibit mean-reverting behavior as short-term panic subsides, providing a long entry edge.",
    "category": "VOLATILITY",
    "rationale": "Sharp, news-driven sell-offs in neutral/bull regimes often overextend due to emotional trading and forced liquidations. A period of compression after the initial spike suggests exhaustion. The edge comes from fading the retail panic while the underlying macro or structural trend remains intact.",
    "entry_conditions": [
      "BTC 1-hour candle closes down >3% on volume >1.5x 20-day average",
      "The drop is accompanied by identifiable negative news headline (macro catalyst, large liquidation report)",

    },
    "falsification_criteria": "More than 55% of such setups continue trending downward beyond the -1.5% stop loss within the 4-hour window, indicating the news catalyst has initiated a genuine regime change rather than a temporary dislocation."

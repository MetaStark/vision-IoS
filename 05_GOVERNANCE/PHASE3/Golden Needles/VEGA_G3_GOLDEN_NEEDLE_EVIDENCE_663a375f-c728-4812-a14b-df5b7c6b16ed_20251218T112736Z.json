    "title": "Neutral Regime Volatility Compression Breakout",
    "statement": "In a NEUTRAL regime, when BTC's 20-day Bollinger Band width contracts to the 25th percentile of its 90-day range, a subsequent daily close outside the bands will lead to a directional move of at least 1.5x the pre-breakout band width in the direction of the breakout over the next 5 trading days.",
    "category": "BREAKOUT",
    "rationale": "Neutral regimes often feature range-bound price action and declining volatility. A compression to extreme lows indicates a buildup of potential energy. A close outside the bands signals a release of this energy, with the market likely to trend in the breakout direction as new information is priced in, rather than immediately snapping back.",

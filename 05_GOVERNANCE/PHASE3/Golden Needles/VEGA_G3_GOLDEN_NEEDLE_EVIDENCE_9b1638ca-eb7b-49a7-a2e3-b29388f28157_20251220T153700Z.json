    "statement": "When a significant price gap (>1.5%) exists between the CME BTC futures Friday close and Sunday open, and the Monday spot market opens in the direction opposite to the gap in a NEUTRAL regime, the gap will close within 3 trading days, providing a mean-reversion entry opportunity.",
    "category": "TIMING",
    "rationale": "CME gaps have a strong historical tendency to fill. A move against the gap at the weekly open suggests initial overreaction is being rejected. The NEUTRAL regime and SMA band filter increase the odds of a range-bound, mean-reverting environment where this effect is strongest.",

      "CME Friday close to Sunday open gap magnitude > 1.5%",
      "BTC spot price at Monday's 00:00 UTC open has moved *against* the gap (e.g., gap up, but price opens down)",

    "title": "CPI Surprise Amplification via BTC Spot-ETF Flow Divergence",
    "statement": "A positive CPI surprise (headline < 2.8%) will trigger a 2-hour BTC price surge that is amplified by 40%+ when accompanied by a concurrent reversal from daily net ETF outflows to inflows (>$50M) within the same 2-hour window, compared to the price move following the CPI print alone.",
    "category": "CATALYST_AMPLIFICATION",
    "rationale": "Recent CPI prints have shown outsized sensitivity in crypto. The catalyst (CPI) provides the initial impulse, but concurrent ETF flow reversal provides the amplification mechanism, confirming institutional re-engagement and adding fuel to the retail/sentiment move. The combination creates a stronger, more sustained short-term momentum.",
    "entry_conditions": [
      "US CPI headline print comes in at or below 2.7% (surprise vs. consensus ~2.8%)",
      "BTC 15-min candle closes above its 15-min VWAP within 30 minutes post-print",

      "take_profit": "2-hour post-CPI window closes OR price reaches +5% from entry (whichever comes first)",

      "time_exit": "2 hours after CPI release"
    },
    "falsification_criteria": "A positive CPI surprise with concurrent ETF inflows results in a BTC price move statistically indistinguishable from (or less than) a move following a CPI surprise without the flow reversal, over a 2-hour window."

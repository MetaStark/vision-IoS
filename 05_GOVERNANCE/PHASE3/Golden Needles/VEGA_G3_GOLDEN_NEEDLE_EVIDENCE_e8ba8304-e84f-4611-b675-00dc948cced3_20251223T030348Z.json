    "title": "Neutral-to-Bear Regime Shift on Failed High-Volume Breakout",
    "statement": "When BTC is in a NEUTRAL regime and experiences a high-volume (>1.5x 30-day average) breakout attempt above a key resistance level (e.g., 90-day high) that fails to close above it, followed by a 4-hour close back below the level, a transition to a BEAR regime is likely within the next 48 hours, presenting a short opportunity.",
    "category": "REGIME_EDGE",
    "rationale": "In a neutral, indecisive market, a high-volume failure at a key technical level represents a classic 'bull trap.' It signals exhaustion of buying pressure and a shift in order flow, often preceding a bearish regime as disappointed longs exit and new shorts enter. The high volume confirms significant participation in the failed move.",
    "entry_conditions": [
      "Current regime == NEUTRAL (confidence > 60%)",
      "BTC price makes a 4-hour candle with volume > 1.5x 30-day avg, pushing above the 90-day high",
      "The 4-hour candle CLOSES below the 90-day high (failed breakout)",

      "take_profit": "15% price drop from entry OR regime model shifts to BEAR (confidence > 70%)",

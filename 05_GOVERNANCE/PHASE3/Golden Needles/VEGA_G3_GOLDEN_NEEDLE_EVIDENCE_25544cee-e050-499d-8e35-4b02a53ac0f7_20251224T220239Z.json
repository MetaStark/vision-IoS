    "title": "Contrarian Fade of Panic-Headline Rallies",
    "statement": "A sharp intraday price spike (>4% in 2 hours) on high volume (>150% of 20-day average) that is directly attributed in news/social sentiment analysis to a 'panic' or 'FUD' event (e.g., exchange rumors, regulatory threats) will be partially retraced within 24 hours. Fading this spike by shorting at the peak provides a positive expectancy.",
    "category": "CONTRARIAN",
    "rationale": "Panic-driven rallies are often fueled by short covering and emotional buying, not sustainable organic demand. They tend to exhaust quickly as the initial fear subsides and profit-taking occurs. The high volume confirms the emotional participation, making the move prone to reversal.",

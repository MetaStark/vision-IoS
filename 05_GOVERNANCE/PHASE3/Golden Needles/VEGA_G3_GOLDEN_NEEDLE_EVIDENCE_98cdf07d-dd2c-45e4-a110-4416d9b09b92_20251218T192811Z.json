    "title": "Negative Macro Catalyst Amplification in Neutral Regime",
    "statement": "In a NEUTRAL regime (confidence > 55%), a negative macro catalyst (e.g., hawkish central bank signal, geopolitical escalation) will trigger a BTC price decline that is 1.8-2.5x larger than the initial 1-hour move, as measured by the 4-hour close, due to amplified risk-off flows from leveraged long positions.",
    "category": "CATALYST_AMPLIFICATION",
    "rationale": "Neutral regimes often have elevated leverage (longs) due to directional uncertainty. A clear negative catalyst triggers disproportionate liquidations, creating a self-reinforcing downward move. The Japan rate hike news provides a proximate catalyst example.",
    "entry_conditions": [
      "Regime == NEUTRAL (confidence > 55%)",
      "Negative macro catalyst identified via news sentiment score < -0.7 (on -1 to 1 scale) within a 1-hour window",
      "BTC 1-hour candle closes down > 2.5% from pre-catalyst level",
      "BTC funding rates positive (> 0.005% per 8h) indicating leveraged longs"

      "take_profit": "Price reaches -4.5% to -6.0% from entry (targeting 1.8-2.5x amplification of initial move)",

      "time_exit": "24 hours after entry if neither TP nor SL hit"
    },
    "falsification_criteria": "In NEUTRAL regimes, negative catalysts produce median 4-hour moves less than 1.5x the initial 1-hour move, or more than 30% of such events see rapid reversal within 4 hours."

    "statement": "A negative news catalyst that drives the annualized BTC perpetual futures funding rate sharply negative (< -25% annualized) while spot price is in a NEUTRAL or BULL regime represents an overreaction. When the funding rate recovers back above -10% within 12 hours, it signals the forced shorting catalyst has been absorbed. A long position entered on this funding rate reversal will benefit from an amplified squeeze as the excessive short bias unwinds.",
    "category": "CATALYST_AMPLIFICATION",
    "rationale": "Extreme negative funding in a non-bear market is unsustainable and indicates panic shorting by leveraged traders, not fundamental selling. The rapid reversion towards zero shows the selling pressure is exhausted. The subsequent move is amplified by two forces: 1) Shorts paying funding begin to cover, 2) Longs are incentivized to hold and collect funding, creating a positive feedback loop.",

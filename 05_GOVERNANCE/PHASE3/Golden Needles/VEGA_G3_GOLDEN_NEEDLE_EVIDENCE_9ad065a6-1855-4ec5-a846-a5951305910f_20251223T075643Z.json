    "title": "Macro Catalyst Divergence: Strong USD as a Crypto Bull Signal in Neutral Regime",
    "statement": "In a NEUTRAL regime, a sharp, catalyst-driven rally in the US Dollar Index (DXY > +0.8% in a session) that coincides with stable/rising BTC prices creates a powerful, counter-intuitive long signal for BTC over the next 3-5 days.",
    "category": "REGIME_EDGE",
    "rationale": "In a Neutral regime, crypto is often range-bound and searching for a directional catalyst. A strong, news-driven USD rally that *fails* to push crypto down demonstrates remarkable underlying strength and absorption of selling pressure. This divergence suggests crypto is decoupling as a risk asset and may be anticipating a different macro narrative (e.g., currency debasement), leading to imminent outperformance.",

      "DXY rallies >0.8% in a single 24-hour period on a clear macro catalyst (e.g., hawkish central bank, strong data).",

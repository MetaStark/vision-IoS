    "statement": "When BTC is in a NEUTRAL regime (confidence > 60%) and its 24-hour RSI crosses below 30 or above 70, a mean reversion move of at least 3% back towards the 50 level will occur within the next 48 hours, with the highest probability of success when volume is below its 20-day average.",
    "category": "MEAN_REVERSION",
    "rationale": "Neutral regimes are characterized by range-bound price action and lack of strong directional momentum. Extreme RSI readings in low-volume environments are often driven by short-term sentiment or liquidity gaps, not fundamental shifts, creating high-probability reversion setups. The volume filter helps avoid catching 'breakdown/breakout' moves that can occur on high volume.",

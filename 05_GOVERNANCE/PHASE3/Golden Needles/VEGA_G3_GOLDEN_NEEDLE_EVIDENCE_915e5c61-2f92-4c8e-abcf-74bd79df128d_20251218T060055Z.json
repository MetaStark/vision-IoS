    "title": "Post-News Volatility Compression Reversal",
    "statement": "Following a significant negative news catalyst (e.g., major liquidation event, regulatory headline) that causes a sharp 1-hour price drop (>3%) on elevated volume (>150% of 20-day avg), the subsequent 4-hour period will exhibit mean-reverting price action as short-term panic selling exhausts, providing a long entry edge.",
    "category": "VOLATILITY",
    "rationale": "Sharp negative news often triggers algorithmic and emotional selling that overshoots fair value. In neutral/bull regimes, this creates a liquidity vacuum that is quickly filled by value buyers and arbitrage bots once panic subsides, especially when evidenced by negative funding rates (traders paying to be short).",
    "entry_conditions": [
      "BTC 1-hour close >3% below previous close on volume >150% of 20-day average",
      "4-hour RSI(14) enters oversold territory (<30) within 2 hours of the news spike",
      "Funding rates turn negative (perpetual futures) indicating excessive bearish sentiment",
      "Price stabilizes above the low of the initial spike candle for 1 consecutive hour"
    ],
    "exit_conditions": {
      "take_profit": "Price retraces 50% of the initial news-driven drop",
      "stop_loss": "Price breaks below the low of the initial spike candle by 0.5%",
      "time_exit": "24 hours after entry if neither TP nor SL hit"
    },
    "falsification_criteria": "More than 55% of such setups continue trending downward beyond the initial spike low within 24 hours, indicating the catalyst reveals structural weakness rather than transient panic."

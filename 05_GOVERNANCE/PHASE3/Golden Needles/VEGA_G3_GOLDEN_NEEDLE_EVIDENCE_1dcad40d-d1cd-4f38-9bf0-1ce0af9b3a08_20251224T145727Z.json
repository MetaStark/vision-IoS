    "statement": "During NEUTRAL regimes, a significant price drop (>3%) on the Friday before a major US holiday weekend (e.g., Christmas, Thanksgiving) followed by low weekend volume (<30% of 20-day avg) presents a high-probability mean reversion opportunity, with a bounce expected by the following Tuesday's market open.",

    "rationale": "Holiday-induced selling pressure from ETFs/traders reducing weekend risk exposure creates exaggerated moves. The subsequent liquidity vacuum and lack of follow-through selling over the weekend, combined with a return of institutional bids post-holiday, often leads to a reversal. Current news mentions a 'holiday lull' and ETF outflows, setting up this dynamic.",

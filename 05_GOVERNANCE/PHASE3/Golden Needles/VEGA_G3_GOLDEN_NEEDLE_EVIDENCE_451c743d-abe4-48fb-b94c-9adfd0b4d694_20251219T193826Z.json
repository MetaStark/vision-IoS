    "category": "TIMING",
    "rationale": "Stablecoin supply is a direct measure of on-chain liquidity available for crypto purchases. Sustained contraction indicates capital leaving the ecosystem. A reversal from this trend is a fundamental prerequisite for a sustained bullish move, as new dry powder enters the system. It often leads price and regime changes.",

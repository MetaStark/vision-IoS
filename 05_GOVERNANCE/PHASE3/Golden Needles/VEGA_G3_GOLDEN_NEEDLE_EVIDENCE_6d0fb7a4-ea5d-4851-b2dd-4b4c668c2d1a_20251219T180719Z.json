    "title": "BTC Volatility Compression Breakout with Volume Confirmation",
    "statement": "When Bitcoin's 10-day Bollinger Band width (20,2) contracts below 0.15 (15% of price) during a NEUTRAL regime, and price subsequently closes above the upper band with volume exceeding its 20-day average by 50%, a sustained directional move in the breakout direction will occur over the next 5 days, yielding a risk-adjusted return > 1.5.",
    "category": "BREAKOUT",
    "rationale": "Extended periods of low volatility (compression) often precede significant directional moves. The NEUTRAL regime suggests indecision and coiled energy. A volume-confirmed breakout from this compression signals institutional or strong directional commitment, reducing false breakouts.",

      "BTC 10-day BB width < 0.15",
      "BTC daily close > upper BB (20,2)",

    },
    "falsification_criteria": "More than 40% of such signals result in a 'fakeout' where price closes back inside the band within 2 days, or the 5-day forward return does not significantly outperform a simple buy-and-hold during the same regime."

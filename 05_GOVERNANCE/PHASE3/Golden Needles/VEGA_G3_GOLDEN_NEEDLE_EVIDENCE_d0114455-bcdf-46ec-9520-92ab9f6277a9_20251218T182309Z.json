    "statement": "When BTC is in a NEUTRAL regime and news headlines explicitly cite technical or fundamental reasons for 'more downside' (e.g., '5 Reasons... Why More Downside Is Possible'), and BTC is trading within 3% of a major, widely-watched support level (e.g., prior weekly low, 50-day MA), implied volatility (BTC DVOL or ATM options IV) will rise disproportionately more for puts than for calls over the next 36 hours, creating a skew expansion trade opportunity.",
    "category": "VOLATILITY",
    "rationale": "In neutral regimes near key support, fear-based narratives can disproportionately impact option pricing before spot price moves materially. The news catalyst amplifies the perceived risk of a breakdown, causing option dealers to hedge by demanding higher premiums for downside protection (puts), widening the skew. This is a 'fear premium' capture trade.",

    "statement": "Following the announced end of Fed QT and $13.5B liquidity injection, crypto markets will experience a 48-hour period of suppressed volatility (BTC 1D realized vol < 40%) before a directional breakout exceeding 2.5x the recent ATR, with the direction favoring the pre-news 4H trend.",

    "rationale": "Macro liquidity injections historically precede risk-asset rallies, but the initial reaction is often a 'digestion' period of low volatility as the market assesses the flow.

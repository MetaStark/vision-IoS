    "title": "Failed L2 Breakdown as Bullish Reversal Signal",
    "statement": "If a major L2 token (ARB) breaks below a key 30-day support level on low volume (<90% of 20-day avg) and reclaims that level within 48 hours, it signals a bear trap and will lead to a rapid mean reversion rally of at least +15% over the following 8 trading days.",
    "category": "MEAN_REVERSION",
    "rationale": "A low-volume breakdown suggests a lack of committed selling. A swift reclaim indicates the move was a 'stop hunt' or liquidity grab. In a sector with positive narrative momentum (L2 breakout analysis in news), this failed bearish move often leads to a violent short squeeze and rally as weak hands are flushed out.",

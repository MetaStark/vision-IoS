    "title": "Asymmetric ETF Flow Impact in Neutral Regime",
    "statement": "In a NEUTRAL regime (confidence 55-70%), a single-day Bitcoin ETF net outflow exceeding $300M will have a disproportionately large negative impact on BTC price (-2 to -4%) over the next 24 hours compared to the impact of equivalent inflows (+1 to +2%), due to negative sentiment amplification and derivative market deleveraging.",
    "category": "CROSS_ASSET",
    "rationale": "In uncertain (Neutral) markets, negative catalysts are psychologically weighted more heavily than positive ones (loss aversion). Large ETF outflows are a tangible, headline-grabbing metric that can trigger retail fear, force liquidations in leveraged long positions, and lead to negative feedback loops not seen with similar-sized inflows.",

    "statement": "Following a major scheduled catalyst (CPI/FOMC) that results in a sharp intraday reversal (>3% BTC move) but closes within \u00b11.5% of pre-announcement levels, the subsequent 24-hour period will see a directional move that amplifies the initial post-announcement impulse, as trapped liquidity and repositioning flows dominate.",

    "category": "TIMING",
    "rationale": "In a sustained bear regime, high-conviction buying is scarce. A sharp price move on sub-par volume is characteristic of short-covering or weak-handed longs, not new institutional demand. This creates a 'bear market rally' trap. The strong close entices late momentum buyers, who then become immediate sellers on any stall, leading to a swift and predictable retracement. The timing edge is shorting the exhaustion of the low-volume spike.",

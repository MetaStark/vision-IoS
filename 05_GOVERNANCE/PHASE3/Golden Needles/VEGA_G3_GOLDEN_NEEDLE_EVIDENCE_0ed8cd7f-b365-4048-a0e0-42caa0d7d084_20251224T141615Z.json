    "statement": "During NEUTRAL or BEAR regimes, a sharp, high-volume down day in BTC (-4% or more) will trigger a subsequent 2-day surge in meme coin volatility (PEPE, DOGE) disproportionate to their price move, creating a scalp opportunity via long volatility strategies.",

    "rationale": "When BTC sells off, speculative capital often flees to sidelines. In the immediate aftermath, the most speculative assets (meme coins) experience violent, directionless swings as weak hands exit and volatile traders attempt bottom-fishing, leading to a predictable short-term volatility expansion.",

      "Regime is NEUTRAL or BEAR",
      "BTC has a daily close down >= 4% on above-average volume",

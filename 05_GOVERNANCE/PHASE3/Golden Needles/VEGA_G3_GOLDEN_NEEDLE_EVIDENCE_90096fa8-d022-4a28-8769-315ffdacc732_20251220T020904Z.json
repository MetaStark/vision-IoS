    "category": "TIMING",
    "rationale": "In neutral, range-bound conditions, options dealer gamma positioning becomes a dominant short-term driver. As spot approaches a large strike near equity close, dealers adjust delta hedges, often creating a 'pin' effect or repulsion. This is amplified before the equity close when cross-asset desks reduce overall risk.",

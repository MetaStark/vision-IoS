    "title": "Volatility Suppression Breakout Following Dovish Catalyst",
    "statement": "During NEUTRAL/BULL regimes with suppressed volatility (BTC 20-day realized vol < 40%), the arrival of a clear positive macro catalyst (e.g., dovish Fed comments, soft inflation data) will trigger a volatility expansion breakout. A long entry on a break above the overnight range high will capture amplified momentum as systematic and options-related flows compound the move.",
    "category": "VOLATILITY",
    "rationale": "Low volatility environments act as coiled springs. A clear catalyst provides the energy for a directional move. The breakout is amplified by vol-targeting funds increasing exposure, short gamma dealers hedging, and momentum algorithms piling in.",
    "entry_conditions": [
      "Pre-condition: BTC 20-day realized volatility < 40%",
      "Clear positive macro catalyst occurs during trading hours",
      "BTC price trades above the high of the prior day's (UTC) range",
      "1-hour RSI < 70 (not overbought at breakout)",
      "Entry on break above day's high + 0.1% buffer"

    "exit_conditions": {
      "take_profit": "Target based on 1x the average true range (ATR) of the prior 5 days, added to entry",
      "stop_loss": "Low of the breakout candle",
      "time_exit": "Close of the daily candle after entry"
    },
    "falsification_criteria": "Breakouts following such catalysts in low vol regimes fail (hit stop before target) >60% of the time, or average win is less than average loss."

    "statement": "Significant news (e.g., prediction-market lawsuit developments, geopolitical event) breaking during weekend Asian/European trading hours (Sat 00:00 \u2013 Sun 12:00 UTC) will cause an exaggerated price move in BTC (>2x typical intraday volatility) due to thin liquidity, which will partially reverse (>40% retracement) during US Sunday evening liquidity refresh.",
    "category": "TIMING",
    "rationale": "Weekend markets have lower market maker presence and institutional participation. News-driven orders encounter shallower order books, creating oversized moves. As professional desks return Sunday evening (US), they provide liquidity and often fade exaggerated moves, especially if the news isn't fundamentally game-changing.",

      "Major crypto/ macro news headline occurs between Sat 00:00 and Sun 12:00 UTC",
      "BTC price moves >3.5% within 2 hours of the news on spot exchanges",

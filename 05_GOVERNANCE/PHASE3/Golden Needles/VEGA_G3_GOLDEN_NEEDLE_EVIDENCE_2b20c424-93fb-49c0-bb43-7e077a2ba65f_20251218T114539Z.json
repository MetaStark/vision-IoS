    "title": "High-Frequency VWAP Breakout Fade in Stress Regimes",
    "statement": "During STRESS or sharp BEAR regimes, a 15-minute candle closing more than 1.8% above the 12-hour Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP), on volume exceeding the 15-min average by 200%, will be followed by a reversion towards VWAP. A fade (short) entry at the close of that candle will be profitable as price mean-reverts to within 0.5% of VWAP within the next 4 hours.",
    "category": "MEAN_REVERSION",
    "rationale": "In panicked or strongly bearish environments, liquidity is poor and rallies are often driven by short covering or trapped longs, not sustainable buying. A sharp, high-volume spike away from the core VWAP anchor represents an exhaustion move, creating a high-probability fade opportunity as market structure remains weak.",

      "Regime == STRESS or (Regime == BEAR and 24h return < -3%)",

    "statement": "When the market is in NEUTRAL regime (confidence >90%) and experiences 3 consecutive days of declining 20-day realized volatility below its 30-day average, a breakout above the 20-day high on expanding volume (>1.5x 20-day average) signals a transition to BULL regime with 85% probability within 5 trading days.",

    "rationale": "Volatility compression in neutral markets often precedes directional moves. The combination of declining volatility (indicating equilibrium) followed by high-volume breakout suggests institutional accumulation and regime change initiation.

    "title": "New App/Product Launch Momentum Fade",
    "statement": "A sharp price spike (\u22658% in 4 hours) in a major altcoin (e.g., AVAX, BNB) immediately following a high-profile mobile app or product launch announcement (like Guavy) is primarily a 'news pump' and will fully retrace the move within 48 hours in a NEUTRAL regime, providing a shorting edge.",
    "category": "TIMING",
    "rationale": "Product launches are often 'sell the news' events, especially in neutral markets where sustained momentum is scarce. The initial spike is driven by retail FOMO and algorithmic news scanners, not fundamental re-rating. The cited news about 'Guavy' and 'New Crypto Coins Timing Edge' suggests this narrative is active. The retracement is fueled by profit-taking and the realization that the launch does not immediately change network fundamentals.",

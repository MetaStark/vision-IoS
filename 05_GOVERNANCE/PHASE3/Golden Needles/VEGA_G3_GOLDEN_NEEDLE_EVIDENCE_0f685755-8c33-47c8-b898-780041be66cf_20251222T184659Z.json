    "title": "Neutral-to-Bear Transition via Volatility Compression Break",
    "statement": "When BTC trades in a NEUTRAL regime with 20-day realized volatility below 40% and 10-day ATR compression to <1.5% of price, a downside break of the 20-day Bollinger Band lower bound with >2x average volume will signal a transition to BEAR regime with 70% probability, offering a short entry opportunity.",
    "category": "REGIME_EDGE",
    "rationale": "Extended low volatility in neutral regimes often precedes directional breaks. Volume-confirmed breakdowns through established support (Bollinger Band) suggest institutional selling and regime change initiation. High ETH/BTC correlation confirms broad crypto weakness rather than isolated BTC move.",

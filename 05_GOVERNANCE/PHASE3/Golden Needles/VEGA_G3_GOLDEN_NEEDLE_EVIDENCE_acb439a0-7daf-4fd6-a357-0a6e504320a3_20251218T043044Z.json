    "statement": "Following a high-impact news event (e.g., major regulatory announcement, CPI print), a sharp, high-volume price move followed by a 4-hour period of compressed volatility (ATR(4h) < 0.5 * ATR(24h)) will lead to a continuation of the initial move's direction within the next 12 hours.",

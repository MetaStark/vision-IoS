    "statement": "For lower-liquidity approved alts (e.g., BAT, CRV, TRUMP), a price move exceeding +/-15% within 2 hours following a news headline (categorized by news sentiment engine) will partially revert within the next 6 hours when the overall market regime is NEUTRAL.",
    "category": "MEAN_REVERSION",
    "rationale": "Low-liquidity altcoins are prone to exaggerated, knee-jerk reactions to news as order books are thin. In a neutral broader market, the initial overreaction is often driven by emotional retail trading and is subsequently faded by more sophisticated actors, leading to a partial retracement as liquidity normalizes.",

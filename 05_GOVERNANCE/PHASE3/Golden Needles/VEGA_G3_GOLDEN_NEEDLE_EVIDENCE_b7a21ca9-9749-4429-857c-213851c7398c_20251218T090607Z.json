    "title": "Liquidation-Cluster Support Bounce",
    "statement": "A catalyst-driven price drop that triggers a concentrated cluster of long liquidations (e.g., '$600M in liquidations') will create a temporary but strong support level at the price point where the liquidation cascade decelerates sharply (>70% drop in liquidation volume over 2 hours). A bounce of at least 50% of the initial catalyst-driven drop will occur from this support within 12 hours.",
    "category": "MEAN_REVERSION",
    "rationale": "Massive liquidation events often represent a forced, non-fundamental clearing of leveraged positions. Once the forced selling exhausts, the absence of natural sellers at that level, combined with bargain-hunting and short covering, provides fuel for a technical bounce. The news explicitly mentions liquidations, highlighting this mechanism.",
    "entry_conditions": [
      "Observe a peak in hourly long liquidation volume exceeding the 95th percentile of the last 30 days",
      "Subsequent 2-hour total liquidation volume drops to <30% of that peak volume",
      "Price consolidates for at least 2 hourly candles within a 1% range of the low established post-liquidation peak"

    "exit_conditions": {
      "take_profit": "Price reaches a level equal to 50% of the range from the pre-catalyst high to the post-liquidation low",
      "stop_loss": "Price breaks below the post-liquidation consolidation range low by >1.5%",
      "time_exit": "12 hours after entry"
    },
    "falsification_criteria": "Price continues to decline steadily on high volume after liquidations subside, indicating fundamental selling pressure outweighing the technical liquidation exhaustion."

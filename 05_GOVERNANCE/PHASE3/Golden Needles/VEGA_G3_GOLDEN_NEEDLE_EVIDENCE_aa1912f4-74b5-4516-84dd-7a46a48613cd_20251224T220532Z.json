    "title": "Intraday V-Shaped Reversal After High-Volume Liquidation Spike",
    "statement": "Following a high-volume, sharp price decline (or rise) within a single 1-hour candle that triggers significant liquidations (> $50M in 1h for BTC), a rapid, V-shaped partial retracement (> 50% of the initial spike move) will occur within the next 3 hours, providing a quick mean reversion scalp.",
    "category": "MEAN_REVERSION",
    "rationale": "Sharp, high-volume moves fueled by liquidations often overshoot due to forced selling/buying. Once the liquidation cascade subsides, natural bid/ask imbalance and opportunistic buying/selling often cause a partial retracement. This is a micro-structure mean reversion play.",
    "entry_conditions": [
      "Any regime (including STRESS, but tested separately)",
      "1h candle has absolute return > 3% and volume > 150% of 20-period average",
      "Estimated 1h liquidation volume (from derivatives data) exceeds $50M for BTC or proportional for ETH",
      "Entry on the close of the spike candle, in the direction opposite the spike"

      "take_profit": "Price retraces 50% of the initial spike candle's range",
      "stop_loss": "Price moves 1.5x the spike candle's range in the adverse direction (beyond the spike extreme)",
      "time_exit": "3 hours after entry"
    },
    "falsification_criteria": "The retracement fails to reach 50% of the initial spike move in more than 60% of cases within the 3-hour window, indicating the move is sustained or leads to a new trend rather than a reversion."

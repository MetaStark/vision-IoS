    "title": "Liquidation-Cluster Catalyst Retest Fade",
    "statement": "When a catalyst triggers a violent liquidation event (>$300M cross-crypto in 1H) that pushes price through a high-liquidity zone (e.g., major options strike, yearly open), a retest of the post-liquidation extreme within the next 12 hours will fail 70% of the time, offering a high Sharpe fade opportunity.",
    "category": "MEAN_REVERSION",
    "rationale": "Violent liquidations are often exacerbated by derivative mechanics and represent a local exhaustion of momentum. The retest of the extreme often lacks the same selling/buying pressure, as forced positions are already cleared. The Dec 19 move (CPI, $600M liquidations) is a prime example.",
    "entry_conditions": [
      "Catalyst triggers >$300M in cross-crypto liquidations (long+short) within 1 hour.",
      "Price moves >5% during the liquidation hour, clearly sweeping a known liquidity zone.",
      "Price then retraces >30% of the liquidation candle's range.",
      "Price re-approaches within 0.5% of the liquidation candle's extreme (wick) over the next 12 hours."

      "time_exit": "18 hours after entry."
    },
    "falsification_criteria": "A study of >30 similar events shows the retest leads to a continuation beyond the extreme >50% of the time, invalidating the fade premise."

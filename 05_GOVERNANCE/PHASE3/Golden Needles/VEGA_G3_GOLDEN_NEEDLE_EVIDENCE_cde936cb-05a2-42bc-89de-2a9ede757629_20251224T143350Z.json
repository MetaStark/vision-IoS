    "statement": "A daily net inflow into SOL-based ETFs (e.g., $750M referenced in news) that is 2 standard deviations above its 20-day average, while BTC ETF flows are neutral or negative, will cause SOL's 10-day implied volatility (IV) to rise by at least 15% relative to BTC's 10-day IV over the following week.",

    "rationale": "Asymmetric, strong ETF inflows into a major altcoin like SOL signal a dedicated risk-on rotation and new, potentially less stable, capital entering the asset.

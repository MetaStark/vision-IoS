    "statement": "Following a period of extreme volatility compression (BTC 20-day realized volatility < 30% annualized) within a NEUTRAL regime, a breakout above the 20-day Bollinger Band upper band on expanding volume (>1.5x 20-day average) signals the start of a directional volatility expansion phase, providing a momentum edge for the next 5-10 days.",

    "rationale": "Extended low volatility in neutral markets often precedes significant directional moves as pent-up energy releases. The combination of compression, a clear technical breakout, and volume confirmation filters false signals. The current news environment (Trump crypto policy, JPMorgan bullish targets) creates latent directional bias that may be triggered by technical catalysts.",

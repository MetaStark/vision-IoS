    "statement": "Following a period of low volatility (BTC 20-day realized vol < 40%) and a neutral-to-bullish regime, a positive CPI surprise (actual < consensus by \u22650.2%) will trigger a 2-hour momentum surge in BTC that exceeds the initial 15-minute move by a factor of 1.5x, as institutional flows amplify the initial retail reaction.",

    "statement": "When the market is in a NEUTRAL regime and experiences a sharp, high-volume volatility spike (\u22652.5x 20-day average) that fails to sustain above key moving average resistance (e.g., 50-day SMA), a short position entered at the failure point will be profitable as price reverts toward the neutral range, signaling a transition toward a BEAR regime.",

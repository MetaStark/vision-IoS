    "statement": "In a NEUTRAL or BULL regime, if BTC price breaks below a key recent support level (e.g., -3% from current price) on low volume (<80% of 20-day average) and then reclaims that level within 12 hours, it will trigger a strong mean-reversion bounce back towards the range high.",
    "category": "MEAN_REVERSION",
    "rationale": "A low-volume breakdown suggests a lack of committed selling. A swift reclaim of the level indicates the breakdown was a 'false move' or liquidity grab, trapping weak shorts. In a non-bearish regime, this often leads to a sharp reversal as trapped positions are covered.",
    "entry_conditions": [
      "BTC 1-hour candle closes >3% below the prior session's low (defining the breakdown).",
      "Volume on breakdown candle is <80% of 20-period average volume.",

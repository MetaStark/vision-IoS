    "statement": "When the market is in a NEUTRAL regime (confidence > 60%) and BTC's 20-day realized volatility compresses below 35% while its price consolidates within a 5% range for 10 consecutive days, a breakout above the consolidation high with >5% daily volume surge signals an imminent transition to a BULL regime, offering a high-probability long entry.",
    "category": "REGIME_EDGE",
    "rationale": "Extended low-volatility consolidation in neutral regimes often precedes significant directional moves. A volume-confirmed breakout from such compression typically indicates accumulation and a shift in market structure. The current regulatory news cycle (MiCA, UK consultations) creates fundamental uncertainty that may resolve directionally.",

    "title": "Volatility-Driven Hedging Flow Amplification in STRESS Regimes",
    "statement": "During a STRESS market regime (high cross-asset vol, deleveraging), a sharp, catalyst-driven down move in BTC (>-7% in 12 hours) will trigger an amplified and disproportionate surge in ETH/BTC implied volatility skew (25-delta risk-reversal) compared to BTC's own skew. This presents a short-term relative value opportunity as the hedging flow panic in ETH subsides faster.",
    "category": "VOLATILITY",
    "rationale": "In stress regimes, leveraged positions in altcoins/ETH are often the first to be liquidated, and options dealers hedge aggressively. This can cause outsized demand for ETH downside protection (puts) relative to BTC, excessively widening ETH's vol skew. This panic hedging tends to normalize faster than the underlying market stress as the immediate liquidation cascade ends, creating a reversion opportunity in relative vol pricing.",
    "entry_conditions": [
      "FjordHQ Regime is STRESS.",
      "BTC drops >7% within a 12-hour window on a identifiable catalyst.",
      "ETH/BTC 25-delta 7-day risk-reversal (ETH vol - BTC vol) widens by more than 8 volatility points (e.g., from +2 to +10) during the same move.",
      "Enter a relative vol trade: Sell ETH 7-day 25-delta risk-reversal / Buy BTC 7-day 25-delta risk-reversal when the spread reaches 8+ vol points."

    "exit_conditions": {
      "take_profit": "ETH/BTC 25-delta risk-reversal spread reverts by 5 volatility points from entry.",

      "time_exit": "96 hours (4 days) after trade entry."
    },
    "falsification_criteria": "During stress events, the ETH/BTC vol skew continues to widen persistently beyond the entry threshold and does not revert within 4 days in >55% of cases, indicating the hedging pressure is fundamental and sustained."

    "statement": "Following a high-impact news event (e.g., major regulatory announcement, CPI print, Fed speech), a sharp, high-volume price spike (>3% in 15 minutes) that fails to sustain and retraces >50% within the next 2 hours will lead to a mean-reverting move back through the pre-spike high/low over the subsequent 4-6 hours.",

    "rationale": "High-impact news often triggers knee-jerk algorithmic and emotional reactions, creating an 'overshoot'.

The retracement and subsequent break of the pre-spike level indicates the dominant market narrative has reasserted itself, targeting the liquidity beyond the initial false spike.",

    "statement": "During STRESS or BEAR market regimes, a sharp intraday price breakout (e.g., >3% move in under 2 hours) that occurs on low relative volume (vs. 1-hour average) and pushes price into overbought territory (RSI(4h) > 75) will fail and revert strongly, providing a high-probability short-term mean reversion opportunity.",
    "category": "MEAN_REVERSION",
    "rationale": "In weak regimes, strong moves\u7f3a\u4e4f sustained buying pressure (low volume) are often liquidity grabs or short squeezes, not fundamental shifts. Overbought conditions in a bearish context are quickly sold into by algorithmic and institutional sellers.",
    "entry_conditions": [
      "Market Regime is STRESS or BEAR.",
      "BTC price rallies >3% within a 2-hour candle.",
      "Volume during the 2-hour breakout candle is < 0.8x the average volume of the prior 10 two-hour candles.",
      "4-hour RSI crosses above 75 during or immediately after the move.",
      "Price reaches a local resistance level (e.g., prior 4-hour high, VWAP)."

    "exit_conditions": {
      "take_profit": "Price retraces 50% of the initial breakout move.",

      "time_exit": "12 hours after entry."
    },
    "falsification_criteria": "Low-volume breakouts in bear markets sustain and continue upwards more than 40% of the time, indicating they are genuine shifts in sentiment rather than traps."

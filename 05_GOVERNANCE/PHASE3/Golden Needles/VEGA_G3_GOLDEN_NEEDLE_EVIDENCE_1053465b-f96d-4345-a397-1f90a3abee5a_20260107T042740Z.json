    "statement": "During NEUTRAL regimes (BTC 30-day volatility 30-60%), a breakdown of the 30-day inverse correlation between BTC and 10Y-2Y Treasury spread (currently -0.4 to -0.6) to near-zero or positive, combined with BTC breaking below its 50-day volume-weighted average price (VWAP), predicts BEAR regime transition within 7 days with 70% accuracy.",

    "rationale": "Neutral regimes often precede directional breaks. The BTC/yield curve correlation represents macro sensitivity. When this relationship breaks during monetary tightening expectations, it suggests crypto losing its 'inflation hedge' narrative and transitioning to risk-off behavior. This preceded June 2022 and August 2023 bear transitions.",

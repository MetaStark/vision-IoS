    "title": "Prediction Market Sentiment as a Contrarian Breakout Fade",
    "statement": "A surge in bullish sentiment on major onchain prediction markets (e.g., Polymarket 'BTC > $100K by [date]' contract trading >70% probability) coinciding with a BTC price approach to key resistance ($90K) will act as a contrarian indicator, and a breakout attempt will fail within the next 72 hours.",
    "category": "TIMING",
    "rationale": "News indicates prediction markets are expanding. These markets often reflect retail sentiment extremes. At resistance, overly bullish consensus can indicate a crowded trade. The combination of high prediction market odds and price at resistance creates a high-probability fade opportunity in a neutral regime.",

      "Price of a leading 'BTC bullish' prediction market contract > 0.70 (70% probability)",
      "BTC price is within 2% of a major resistance level (e.g., $88,200 - $90,000)",

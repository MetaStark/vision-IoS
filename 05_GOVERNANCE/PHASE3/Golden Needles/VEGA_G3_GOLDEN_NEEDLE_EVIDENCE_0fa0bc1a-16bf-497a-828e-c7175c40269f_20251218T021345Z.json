    "title": "BTC Volatility Compression Breakout with Volume Confirmation",
    "statement": "When BTC enters a period of low volatility (Bollinger Band Width < 0.05) within a NEUTRAL regime, a breakout above the 20-period upper Bollinger Band on a closing basis, accompanied by volume exceeding the 20-day average by 150%, will lead to a sustained directional move in the breakout direction over the next 5-10 days.",
    "category": "BREAKOUT",
    "rationale": "Neutral regimes often feature range-bound price action and volatility compression. A high-volume breakout from such a compression zone signals a potential shift in market structure and the initiation of a new trend, as accumulated energy is released. The volume filter helps distinguish genuine breakouts from false moves.",

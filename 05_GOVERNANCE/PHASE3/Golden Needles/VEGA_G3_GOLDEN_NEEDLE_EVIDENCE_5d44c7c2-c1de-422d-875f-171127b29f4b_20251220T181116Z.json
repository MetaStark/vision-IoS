    "statement": "Following a large options expiry event (like the recent $23B BTC expiry), if BTC consolidates within a \u00b11.5% range for 24-36 hours post-expiry under NEUTRAL regime, a directional breakout in the direction of the initial 1-hour move after the breakout will yield a 2:1 risk/reward over the next 12 hours.",

    "rationale": "Large options expiries remove gamma hedging flows that suppress volatility.

The initial 1-hour direction post-breakout indicates which side of the order book is dominant.",

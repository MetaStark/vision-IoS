    "title": "Japan Rate Hike FUD Creates Asymmetric Short-Term Volatility Spike Opportunity",
    "statement": "In a NEUTRAL regime, when a macro catalyst (e.g., Japan rate hike news) triggers a sharp, high-volume BTC drop below a key psychological level (e.g., $85K), implied volatility (IV) will spike disproportionately more than realized volatility (RV) over the next 24-48 hours, creating a profitable short-volatility entry after the initial panic.",
    "category": "VOLATILITY",
    "rationale": "Neutral regimes often see exaggerated volatility reactions to news as directional conviction is low. The 'scarier macro catalyst' headline amplifies fear, but without a fundamental regime shift, IV tends to overshoot. The $600M liquidation headline creates a self-referential fear loop that decays quickly.",

    "title": "Post-Liquidity-Crash Volatility Compression & Regime Break",
    "statement": "After the October 'liquidity crash,' sustained low volatility (BTC 20-day realized volatility < 40%) in a NEUTRAL regime will be followed by a high-magnitude directional move (>8% in 3 days) upon a break of a key technical level, with the direction of the break predicting the short-term trend.",
    "category": "VOLATILITY",
    "rationale": "Major liquidity dislocations (like October's crash) reset market participant positioning. Subsequent periods of low volatility and price compression represent a buildup of latent energy. A break on volume signals a resolution, often leading to a sustained move as new liquidity enters or exits in the direction of the break.",
    "entry_conditions": [
      "Regime is NEUTRAL (confidence > 60%)",
      "BTC 20-day realized volatility < 40% (indicating compression)",
      "Price consolidates within a 5% range for at least 7 days",
      "Price closes outside the 20-day Bollinger Band (2 std dev) on above-average volume (volume > 1.2 * 20-day avg volume)"

    "exit_conditions": {
      "take_profit": "Price reaches a 1:2.5 Risk/Reward ratio based on the width of the preceding consolidation range",
      "stop_loss": "Price re-enters the prior consolidation range (close back inside the 20-day BB)",
      "time_exit": "If no clear follow-through (new 3-day high/low) within 3 days of entry, exit"
    },
    "falsification_criteria": "Multiple instances of volatility compression followed by a technical break that immediately reverses and returns to the range (a 'false break') would disprove the predictive power of the setup in the current market structure."

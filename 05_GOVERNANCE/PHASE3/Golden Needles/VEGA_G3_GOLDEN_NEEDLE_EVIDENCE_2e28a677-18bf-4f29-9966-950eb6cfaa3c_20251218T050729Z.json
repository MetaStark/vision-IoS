    "title": "Post-News Volatility Compression Breakout",
    "statement": "When a significant negative news catalyst (e.g., major liquidation event, regulatory headline) causes a sharp 1-hour price drop (>3%) on elevated volume (>150% of 20-day avg), the subsequent 4-hour period will exhibit a mean-reverting bounce of at least 50% of the initial drop, as panic selling exhausts and algorithmic bargain-hunting amplifies the reversal.",
    "category": "CATALYST_AMPLIFICATION",
    "rationale": "Sharp, news-driven sell-offs in non-bear regimes often represent liquidity events rather than trend changes. High volume indicates capitulation, creating a vacuum for rapid algorithmic buying. The negative sentiment acts as a contrary indicator at extremes.",

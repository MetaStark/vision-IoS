    "title": "Term Structure Flattening Momentum Signal",
    "statement": "When BTC's volatility term structure flattens significantly (30-day IV minus 7-day IV < 2 volatility points) during NEUTRAL/BULL regimes, and the flattening coincides with increasing spot volume (>1.2x 20-day average), the subsequent 7-day price movement will exhibit positive momentum with realized volatility expanding to match the front-end of the term structure.",
    "category": "VOLATILITY",

This often precedes directional moves as dealers hedge gamma exposure. The regime filter avoids bear markets where flattening may indicate capitulation.",

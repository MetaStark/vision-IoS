    "title": "Cross-Asset Correlation Break Amplification",
    "statement": "A sharp, unexpected decoupling of BTC from traditional risk assets (specifically, a -0.8 to -0.9 5-day rolling correlation with NDX breaking down to near 0 or positive within 24 hours) during a NEUTRAL or STRESS regime will be followed by an amplified directional move in BTC as it resumes trading on crypto-specific catalysts, with the direction signaled by the sign of its 4-hour funding rate at the moment of decoupling.",
    "category": "CATALYST_AMPLIFICATION",
    "rationale": "When BTC is tightly coupled to NDX, it's trading as a pure macro risk proxy. A rapid decoupling suggests a shift to a crypto-native driver (e.g., Ethereum ETF news, regulatory clarity, major protocol upgrade). The funding rate at the breakpoint indicates whether the latent crypto-native pressure is bullish (positive funding, shorts paying longs) or bearish. This catalyst (the decoupling itself) amplifies the subsequent crypto-specific move.",
    "entry_conditions": [
      "5-day rolling correlation between BTC and NDX drops from <-0.7 to >-0.2 within a 24-hour window.",
      "The regime is NEUTRAL (confidence >50%) or STRESS.",
      "At the time the correlation break is confirmed, BTC 4-hour perpetual funding rate is persistently positive (>+0.005%) or negative (<-0.005%).",
      "Entry on a 1-hour close confirming the new, low-correlation regime (correlation between -0.2 and +0.2)."

      "stop_loss": "4% loss.",
      "time_exit": "96 hours (4 days) after entry."
    },
    "falsification_criteria": "The decoupling occurs, but BTC price action remains choppy and directionless with no follow-through, and correlation quickly re-asserts itself, proving the decoupling was a statistical noise event, not a regime shift."

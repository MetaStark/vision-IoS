    "statement": "When BTC trades in a NEUTRAL regime with a 4-hour Bollinger Band width (BBW) below its 20-day rolling 25th percentile (indicating a volatility squeeze), a breakout above the upper band on a closing basis, accompanied by a volume spike exceeding the 20-period average by 150%, will lead to a directional move of at least 2.5% in the breakout direction over the next 24 hours.",
    "category": "BREAKOUT",

    "title": "Macro News Catalyst as False Regime Transition Trigger",
    "statement": "A sharp price move (|5-day return| > 10%) triggered by a major macro/regulatory news headline (e.g., key MiCA implementation detail, US ETF decision) that forces an immediate regime classification change (e.g., NEUTRAL \u2192 BULL/BEAR) has a >55% probability of being partially or fully reversed within 15 trading days, as the initial overreaction is digested.",
    "category": "TIMING",
    "rationale": "Markets often overreact to headline news due to sentiment and positioning squeezes. However, without a concurrent shift in fundamental on-chain metrics or sustained volume, these moves can be fleeting. The current environment of evolving regulation (UK, MiCA) is prone to creating such knee-jerk reactions. A rapid regime shift on news alone is statistically likely to be unstable.",
    "entry_conditions": [
      "A major, scheduled macro/regulatory crypto news event occurs (identifiable via news sentiment spike)",
      "The 5-day absolute return following the event is >10%",
      "The FjordHQ regime signal changes within 3 days of the event",

      "time_exit": "15 trading days after the regime change signal"
    },
    "falsification_criteria": "News-induced regime transitions are as likely to persist as to reverse, meaning the initial move correctly anticipates a new, sustained trend driven by the news catalyst's fundamental implications."

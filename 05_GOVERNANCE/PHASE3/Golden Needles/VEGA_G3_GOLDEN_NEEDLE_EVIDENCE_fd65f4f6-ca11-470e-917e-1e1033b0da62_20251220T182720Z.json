    "title": "Post-CPI Volatility Compression Breakout",
    "statement": "Following a major macro catalyst (US CPI print) that results in a sharp intraday move (>3%) but closes within \u00b11% of the pre-announcement price, a period of 6-12 hours of compressed volatility (ATR(1h) < 0.5% of price) will resolve with a directional move that continues the initial intraday spike direction, amplified by trapped liquidity and stop-loss cascades.",
    "category": "CATALYST_AMPLIFICATION",
    "rationale": "Major catalysts create violent but often non-directional 'whipsaws' that trap both sides. The subsequent compression represents a coiled spring as liquidity providers reposition and stop orders accumulate at range edges. The break tends to be explosive as one side's stops trigger a cascade.",
    "entry_conditions": [
      "BTC experiences >3% absolute move within 1 hour of CPI release (8:30 AM ET)",
      "BTC 4-hour closing candle returns to within \u00b11% of price at 8:25 AM ET",
      "Subsequent 6-hour period shows ATR(1h) < 0.5% of price (volatility compression)",
      "Enter on break of 6-hour high (if initial spike was up) or low (if initial spike was down) with >0.8% move from compression range midpoint"
    ],
    "exit_conditions": {
      "take_profit": "1:2 risk-reward ratio (e.g., 2% profit if 1% stop)",
      "stop_loss": "Other side of compression range (e.g., if long, stop below range low)",
      "time_exit": "24 hours after entry if TP/SL not hit"
    },
    "falsification_criteria": "More than 50% of such setups result in a 'false break' that immediately reverses back into the compression range within 2 hours, or volatility remains elevated without a clear compression phase."

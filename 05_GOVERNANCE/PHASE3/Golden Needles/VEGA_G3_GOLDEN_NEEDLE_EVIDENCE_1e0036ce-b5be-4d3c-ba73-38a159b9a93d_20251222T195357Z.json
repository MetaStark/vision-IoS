    "category": "MEAN_REVERSION",
    "rationale": "The ETH/BTC pair represents relative strength between the two largest crypto assets. In healthy (BULL) or consolidating (NEUTRAL) markets, extreme divergences are often caused by short-term, asset-specific narratives or flows (e.g., ETF rumors, staking events). These tend to normalize as attention rotates and valuation gaps are arbitraged. The 30-day mean provides a dynamic equilibrium, and the 1.5\u03c3 band identifies statistically significant extremes.",

    "statement": "Following a >2% pre-market or intraday gap (open vs. previous close) in BTC driven by a scheduled macro news event (US CPI, FOMC), the initial breakout direction will fade 70% of the time, filling at least 50% of the gap within 2 hours. A subsequent breakout in the original gap direction, occurring after this partial fill and accompanied by rising spot volume, will then be valid and trend-continuing.",
    "category": "BREAKOUT",
    "rationale": "Scheduled news often causes knee-jerk reactions and liquidity grabs. The initial move traps late momentum traders. The 'true' institutional or algorithmic direction is often established after this initial volatility settles and the market digests the news flow, leading to a more sustained move.",
    "entry_conditions": [
      "BTC gaps >2% at open or during session (clear price discontinuity)",
      "Gap is attributed to a major scheduled news event",
      "Phase 1 Entry (Fade): Enter short (for up gap) or long (for down gap) at gap open.",
      "Phase 2 Entry (True Breakout): After a 50% gap fill, price moves back beyond the initial gap open level with 1-hour volume > 120% of prior 5-hour average."

    "exit_conditions": {
      "take_profit_phase1": "50% gap fill",

      "time_exit": "Phase1: 2 hours. Phase2: 8 hours."
    },
    "falsification_criteria": "The initial fade fails more than 40% of the time (gap extends immediately), or the Phase 2 'true breakout' has a win rate below 55%, invalidating the two-stage premise."

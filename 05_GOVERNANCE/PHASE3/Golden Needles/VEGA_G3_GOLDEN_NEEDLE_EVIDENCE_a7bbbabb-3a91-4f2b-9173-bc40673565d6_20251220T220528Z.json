    "statement": "When the market is in a NEUTRAL regime and BTC's 20-day realized volatility compresses below 30% while the 5-day/20-day volatility ratio drops below 0.6, a subsequent 2.5% daily price drop below the 20-day moving average will signal a transition to a BEAR regime, with short positions profitable over the next 10 trading days.",
    "category": "REGIME_EDGE",
    "rationale": "Extended low volatility in neutral markets often precedes directional breaks. Compression below 30% with weak volatility momentum suggests exhaustion of range-bound trading. A sharp break below the moving average during this setup has historically led to sustained bearish momentum as stop-losses trigger and sentiment shifts.",

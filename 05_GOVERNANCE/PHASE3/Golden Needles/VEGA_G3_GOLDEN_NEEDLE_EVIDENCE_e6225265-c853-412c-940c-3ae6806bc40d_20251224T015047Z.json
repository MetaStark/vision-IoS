    "statement": "During NEUTRAL regime trading sessions where the 1-hour ATR(14) is in its lowest quartile over the past month, a price touch of the 1H Bollinger Band (20,2) will result in a reversion to the 20-period SMA within the next 3-5 bars, with an 80% success rate.",
    "category": "MEAN_REVERSION",
    "rationale": "Low intraday ATR signifies compression and a lack of directional conviction. In a Neutral regime, this suggests a tight equilibrium. Bollinger Bands act as dynamic support/resistance in such environments. A touch represents a test of the range extreme, which is likely to fail and revert due to a lack of follow-through volume, creating a high-probability, low-risk setup.",

    "falsification_criteria": "If the win rate (price reaching SMA before stop loss) is below 65% across a significant sample (N>100), the hypothesis is falsified. This would indicate bands are not reliable in low-volatility conditions."

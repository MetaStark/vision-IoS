    "statement": "In BEAR or STRESS regimes, a positive price spike (>2% in 30min) driven by a bullish catalyst (e.g., ETF inflow announcement, positive regulatory news) will be aggressively sold into, with price returning to or below pre-spike levels within 2-3 hours, as the dominant regime narrative overpowers the transient catalyst.",

    "rationale": "In entrenched downtrends or risk-off environments, market participants use rallies as exit opportunities. Weak-handed longs from the spike quickly take profits, while new shorts are initiated. The catalyst is viewed as insufficient to change the macro regime, leading to a rapid fade.",

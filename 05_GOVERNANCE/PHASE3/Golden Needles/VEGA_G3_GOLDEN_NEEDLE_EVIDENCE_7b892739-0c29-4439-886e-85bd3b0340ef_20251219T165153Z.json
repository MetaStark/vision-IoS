    "title": "Bear-to-Neutral Transition via RSI Divergence at Key Support",
    "statement": "During a BEAR regime, if BTC forms a lower price low while 4-hour RSI(14) forms a higher low (bullish divergence) at a major historical support level (e.g., prior cycle high, 200-day SMA), and is accompanied by a surge in spot buying volume (>1.5x 20-day average), this signals an impending transition to NEUTRAL regime, offering a tactical long entry.",
    "category": "REGIME_EDGE",

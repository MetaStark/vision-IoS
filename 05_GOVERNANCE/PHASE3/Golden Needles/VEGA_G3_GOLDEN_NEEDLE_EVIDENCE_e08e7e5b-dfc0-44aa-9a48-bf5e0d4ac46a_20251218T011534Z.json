    "title": "Neutral-Regime Liquidity Fade on Bull Run Anticipation Headlines",
    "statement": "During NEUTRAL regimes, prominent media headlines explicitly asking 'When will the bull run begin?' (a sentiment of anticipation, not confirmation) will trigger a short-lived, liquidity-driven price pump that fully fades within 8-12 hours, reverting to the pre-headline VWAP.",
    "category": "REGIME_EDGE",
    "rationale": "In a neutral, low-conviction market, anticipatory headlines exploit hope but lack fundamental catalysts. The initial pump is driven by algos and retail FOMO reacting to keywords, not sustained buying. With underlying liquidity still thin, the move cannot hold and fades as early buyers take profits and no follow-through emerges.",
    "entry_conditions": [
      "Market regime is NEUTRAL (confidence > 55%)",
      "Major crypto news outlet headline contains phrases like 'bull run begin', 'rally ahead?', 'when will...' (sentiment: anticipatory/questioning)",
      "Price pumps >1.8% within 90 minutes of headline publication",
      "Spot volume on the pump is < 125% of the prior 24h average (indicating thin, reactive liquidity)"

    "exit_conditions": {
      "take_profit": "Price returns to within 0.2% of the 12-hour VWAP calculated prior to the headline.",
      "stop_loss": "Price establishes a new 4-hour high above the pump high, on volume >150% of the pump volume.",
      "time_exit": "12 hours after entry."
    },
    "falsification_criteria": "More than 30% of such headline-induced pumps in a neutral regime lead to sustained trending moves (>2% beyond pump high) over the next 24h, invalidating the 'fade' premise."

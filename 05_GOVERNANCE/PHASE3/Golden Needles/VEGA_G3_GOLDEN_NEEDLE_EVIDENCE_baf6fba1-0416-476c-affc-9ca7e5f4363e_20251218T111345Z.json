    "category": "CONTRARIAN",
    "rationale": "A BTC sell-off driven by external macro fears, paired with declining dominance, suggests rotation, not broad crypto risk-off. Money may be moving from BTC to alts as a 'risk-on' bet within the crypto complex. This is a contrarian play against the initial headline panic.",

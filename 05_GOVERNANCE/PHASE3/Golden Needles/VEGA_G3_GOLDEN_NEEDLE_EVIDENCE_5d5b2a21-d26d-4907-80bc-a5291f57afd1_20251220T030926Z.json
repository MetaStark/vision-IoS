    "statement": "In BEAR or STRESS regimes, when price bounces +5% or more from a recent low (e.g., $85K as mentioned) and major news headlines (like the provided example) frame it as a 'contrarian buy signal' or 'strong support bounce,' the bounce will fail and price will retest or break the prior low within the next 5-7 days.",
    "category": "CONTRARIAN",
    "rationale": "In bearish regimes, rallies are often short-covering events or dead cat bounces. When mainstream or social media quickly labels a bounce as a new buying opportunity, it often signals that the 'dumb money' is being drawn in near a local top, just before the dominant downtrend resumes. This is the essence of contrarian news flow analysis.",

      "BTC daily RSI (14) remains below 60 after the bounce",

      "time_exit": "168 hours (7 days) after entry"
    },
    "falsification_criteria": "If price, after such a signaled bounce and news narrative, continues to rally and sustains above the bounce high more than 60% of the time, the hypothesis is wrong."

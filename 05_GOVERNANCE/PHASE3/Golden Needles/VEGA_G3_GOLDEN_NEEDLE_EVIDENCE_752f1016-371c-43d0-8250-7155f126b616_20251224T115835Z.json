    "category": "TIMING",
    "rationale": "Low-volume moves are prone to slippage and manipulation. A strong move late on a Friday, when liquidity naturally drains for the weekend, is particularly suspect. In a neutral regime lacking a strong directional catalyst, the move is likely driven by isolated large orders or short-term momentum algorithms that will be unable to maintain position over the illiquid weekend, leading to a fade.",

    "statement": "Following a period of low volatility (BTC 10-day realized volatility < 40% annualized) in a NEUTRAL regime, the INITIAL breakout attempt\u2014whether upward or downward\u2014will fail and reverse towards the prior range within 3 trading days, offering a contrarian fade opportunity.",
    "category": "CONTRARIAN",
    "rationale": "Low volatility in a Neutral regime indicates equilibrium and a lack of conviction. The first breakout attempt often traps late momentum traders and is met with opposing liquidity from range-bound participants. The below-average volume on the initial move suggests a lack of broad market participation, increasing the odds of a fakeout.",

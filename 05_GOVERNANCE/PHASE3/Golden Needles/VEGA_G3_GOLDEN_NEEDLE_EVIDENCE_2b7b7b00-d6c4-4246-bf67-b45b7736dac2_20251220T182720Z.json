    "statement": "When spot Bitcoin ETFs experience 3+ consecutive days of net outflows totaling >$500M, a single day of net inflows >$200M will trigger a disproportionately large positive price move (>2x the inflow/float impact) as short-term bears cover and momentum algorithms detect trend reversal.",
    "category": "CATALYST_AMPLIFICATION",

The amplification comes from both short covering and momentum traders piling into a perceived narrative shift.",

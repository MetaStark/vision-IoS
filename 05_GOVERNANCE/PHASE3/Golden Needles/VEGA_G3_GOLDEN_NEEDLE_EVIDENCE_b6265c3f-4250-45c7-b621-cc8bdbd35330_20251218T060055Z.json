    "statement": "When a catalyst triggers clustered liquidations (e.g., $600M+ in 24h) pushing price through a key technical level (e.g., 20-day MA, prior support), the exhaustion of these forced sales creates a temporary support zone. A bounce of 2-4% occurs within the next 12 hours as liquidity replenishes.",

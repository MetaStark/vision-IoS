    "statement": "If aggregate crypto market depth fails to recover (remains >20% below its 30-day average) for 5 consecutive days following a neutral-to-bullish news catalyst (e.g., Fed dovish commentary), capital will rotate defensively into high-liquidity, large-cap tokens (BTC, ETH) at the expense of mid-cap alts, creating a short-term mean-reversion opportunity.",
    "category": "REGIME_EDGE",
    "rationale": "A failure of liquidity to respond to positive news is a strong signal of underlying market fragility and 'thin' rallies. In this environment, savvy capital seeks safety and liquidity, favoring the deepest pools (BTC, then ETH), causing a temporary but tradable compression in the ETH/BTC ratio before a potential broader downturn.",

    "falsification_criteria": "Falsified if, in the described conditions, the ETH/BTC ratio continues to decline (fails to mean-revert) in >65% of instances, indicating the rotation is not temporary but a sustained flight to the absolute safest asset (BTC only)."

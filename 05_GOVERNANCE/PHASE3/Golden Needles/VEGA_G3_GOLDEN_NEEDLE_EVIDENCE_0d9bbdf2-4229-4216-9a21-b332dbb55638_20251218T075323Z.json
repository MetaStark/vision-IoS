    "statement": "When a significant negative news catalyst (e.g., macro scare, large liquidation event) causes a sharp 1-hour price drop (>3%) on elevated volume (>1.5x 20-day avg), but the subsequent 4-hour candle closes with a lower wick >50% of the candle body (showing rejection), a long entry will capture a mean-reversion bounce as the initial overreaction is corrected, amplified by short covering.",

    "title": "Low Correlation Cluster Precedes Altcoin Breakout in BULL Regime",
    "statement": "During a confirmed BULL regime, when the 10-day rolling correlation between BTC and a select altcoin (AVAX, SOL) drops below the 5th percentile of its 90-day historical range, it indicates decoupling and accumulation. A subsequent surge in the altcoin's volume (volume 50% above its 20-day MA) will precede a short-term outperformance breakout vs BTC.",
    "category": "TIMING",
    "rationale": "In a bull market, altcoins often begin their major rallies by first decoupling from BTC's daily gyrations (low correlation), signaling a shift in focus. A volume spike on low correlation confirms new, dedicated buying interest, not just beta movement.",
    "entry_conditions": [
      "Regime == BULL (confidence > 70%)",
      "10-day BTC/Altcoin (e.g., AVAX) return correlation < 5th percentile (90-day lookback)",
      "Altcoin's daily trading volume > 1.5 * its 20-day MA volume",
      "Enter long altcoin (AVAXUSD, SOLUSD) at market on the same day volume condition is met."

      "take_profit": "Close position after 7 days or when the altcoin's price gains 15% from entry, whichever comes first.",
      "stop_loss": "Close position if the altcoin price drops 7% from entry.",
      "time_exit": "7 trading days after entry."
    },
    "falsification_criteria": "Falsified if, after meeting both low-correlation and high-volume conditions, the altcoin fails to achieve a positive return over the next 7 days in more than 50% of instances, or if its median return is not statistically greater than the median return of all 7-day periods in a BULL regime."

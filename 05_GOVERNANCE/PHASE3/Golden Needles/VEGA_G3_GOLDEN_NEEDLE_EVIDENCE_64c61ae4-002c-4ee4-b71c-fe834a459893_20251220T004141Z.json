    "statement": "A sharp, >8% spike in the Spot VIX (VIX9D or VIX) occurring within a 90-minute window, while major crypto (BTC/ETH) shows price resilience (range < 0.5 ATR) and declining relative volume (<0.8x its 24hr avg), creates a short-term bullish edge for crypto over the next 6-12 hours as 'fear spillover' subsides.",
    "category": "TIMING",
    "rationale": "Rapid VIX spikes often reflect short-term equity market panic (e.g., index rebalancing, single-stock volatility). If crypto, a correlated but distinct asset, fails to participate in the panic (low range, low volume), it suggests the fear is localized. As the VIX spike mean-reverts, capital may rotate back into resilient assets like crypto, creating a tactical bounce.",

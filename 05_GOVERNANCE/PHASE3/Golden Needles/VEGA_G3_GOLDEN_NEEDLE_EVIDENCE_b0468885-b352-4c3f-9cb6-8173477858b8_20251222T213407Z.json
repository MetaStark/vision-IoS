    "statement": "During STRESS regimes (VIX > 25, crypto vol > 80%), if BTC dominance rallies to test the 65% level but fails to close above it for 2 consecutive days while BTC perpetual funding turns negative, dominance will reverse sharply as forced altcoin selling exhausts and BTC safe-haven flows stall.",

    "rationale": "65% represents extreme psychological resistance where previous bear market peaks formed. During stress events, altcoins experience forced selling first, pushing dominance higher. When BTC funding turns negative at this level, it suggests even BTC longs are capitulating, creating exhaustion. The reversal is amplified by altcoin short-covering.",

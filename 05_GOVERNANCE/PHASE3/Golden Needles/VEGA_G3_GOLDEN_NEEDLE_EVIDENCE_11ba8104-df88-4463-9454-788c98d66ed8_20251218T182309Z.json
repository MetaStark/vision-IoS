    "statement": "During NEUTRAL regimes, when BTC experiences a sharp intraday drop (>5%) on negative macro news headlines, but the BTC futures funding rate remains neutral or slightly positive (within \u00b10.005%), price will mean-revert 50% of the initial drop within the next 24 trading hours.",
    "category": "MEAN_REVERSION",
    "rationale": "In neutral regimes, sharp moves are often driven by sentiment and liquidity flushes rather than structural shifts. If funding rates don't turn significantly negative, it suggests leveraged longs aren't aggressively unwinding, and the drop may be an overreaction to scary headlines. The reversion targets the midpoint of the panic move.",

    "statement": "Following a STRESS regime spike (1-hour realized volatility > 95th percentile), the transition back to a NEUTRAL regime (as per regime classifier) often occurs via a specific pattern: a final sharp, high-volume directional candle that exhausts the move, providing a timing edge to fade the exhaustion candle's extreme.",

    "rationale": "STRESS regimes end with a volatility climax. A high-volume, wide-range candle with a weak close (long wick) suggests a final flush or squeeze that exhausts the dominant momentum. The immediate rejection back into the candle's body signals a potential regime shift, offering a timed entry at the point of momentum reversal.",

      "The subsequent 1-hour candle opens and trades back into the body of the exhaustion candle.",

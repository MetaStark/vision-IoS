    "statement": "Following the announced end of Quantitative Tightening (QT) and $13.5B liquidity injection, capital will rotate from BTC (perceived as digital gold/store of value) into ETH (perceived as tech/growth proxy) within 5 trading days, causing the BTC/ETH ratio to decline by at least 3% from its pre-announcement level.",
    "category": "CROSS_ASSET",
    "rationale": "The end of QT represents a structural shift from liquidity withdrawal to injection. Historically, new liquidity favors higher-beta, 'growth' narratives (ETH) over 'store of value' (BTC) in early stages. The October liquidity crash created oversold conditions in ETH relative to BTC, setting up a mean reversion trade.",

      "Daily net liquidity flow (Fed balance sheet change + reverse repo drain) turns positive for 2 consecutive days",

    "falsification_criteria": "BTC/ETH ratio continues to rise or remains flat despite positive liquidity flows for 5+ days, indicating either 1) liquidity is not reaching crypto markets, or 2) BTC's store-of-value narrative is overpowering growth rotation."

    "title": "Term Structure Inversion as a Bear Regime Signal",
    "statement": "In a NEUTRAL or early BEAR regime, when the BTC volatility term structure inverts (1-month IV > 3-month IV) by more than 5 volatility points, and the 1-month 25-delta put skew is greater than 10%, a tactical short position in BTC (or long put position) initiated at close will be profitable over the next 10 trading days as near-term fear materializes into price decline.",
    "category": "VOLATILITY",
    "rationale": "An inverted vol term structure (front-end > back-end) indicates acute near-term uncertainty and fear, often preceding downside realized volatility. Coupled with expensive puts (high skew), it suggests strong demand for downside protection. In a non-bullish price environment (below 50DMA), this combination has historically led to negative price action as hedges are exercised or delta-hedging from dealers exerts downward pressure.",

    },
    "falsification_criteria": "Median 10-day BTC return after signal is \u2265 0%, or the win rate for the short position is < 55% in historical NEUTRAL/BEAR regimes, showing the inversion is not a reliable bearish timing signal."

    "statement": "During STRESS regimes (VIX > 25, BTC 10-day vol > 80%), a positive regulatory development headline (e.g., clear MiCA guidance, favorable court ruling) triggers a sharp but transient rally of 8-12% within 24 hours, followed by a 3-day consolidation back to pre-spike levels as structural concerns remain.",

Regulatory news provides a catalyst for shorts to cover, but underlying macro/structural issues (e.g., 2027 FCA rollout uncertainty) remain unresolved, leading to fade.",

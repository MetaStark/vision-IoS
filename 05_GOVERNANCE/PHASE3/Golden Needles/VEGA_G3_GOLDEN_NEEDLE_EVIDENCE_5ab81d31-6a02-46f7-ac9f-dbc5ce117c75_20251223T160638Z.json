    "category": "MEAN_REVERSION",
    "rationale": "In neutral, range-bound markets, large deviations in the core ETH/BTC ratio are often driven by fleeting sentiment or leveraged flows. A divergence with the CVD\u2014a proxy for net spot market order flow\u2014suggests the move lacks sustainable buying/selling pressure. This creates a high-probability setup for the ratio to revert towards its mean as unsustainable momentum fades.",

      "Trigger: Close of the 4h candle confirming the divergence (e.g., ratio's new high close with CVD failing to confirm)",

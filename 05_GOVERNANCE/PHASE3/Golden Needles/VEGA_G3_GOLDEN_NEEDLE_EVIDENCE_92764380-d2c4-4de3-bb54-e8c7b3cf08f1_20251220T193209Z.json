    "title": "Liquidation Cascade Amplification in High-Funding Environments",
    "statement": "In a high perpetual swap funding rate environment (\u22650.05% per 8hr), an initial catalyst-driven price move of \u22653% that triggers liquidations exceeding $150M in 1 hour will be amplified into a short-term trend as sequential long/short squeezes cascade, with momentum decaying predictably after funding resets to neutral.",
    "category": "CATALYST_AMPLIFICATION",
    "rationale": "High absolute funding rates indicate crowded one-way leverage. A catalyst provides the initial shove. The first wave of liquidations pushes price further, triggering stop-losses and deleveraging in a reflexive cascade. This creates a self-fueling move that typically exhausts only when the extreme leverage (funding) is flushed out.",

      "1-hour cross-exchange liquidation volume exceeds $150M in the direction opposite the initial funding bias (e.g., negative price move during high positive funding)",

    "title": "Negative News Catalyst Amplification in Neutral Regime",
    "statement": "When BTC is in NEUTRAL regime (confidence > 60%) and experiences a negative macro catalyst (e.g., regulatory news, ETF outflows > $200M), the initial 2-hour sell-off will be amplified by 1.8-2.2x relative to the 30-day average volatility, creating a short-term oversold bounce opportunity within 6-12 hours.",
    "category": "CATALYST_AMPLIFICATION",
    "rationale": "Neutral regimes lack strong directional bias, making them prone to overreaction to catalysts. Negative news triggers algorithmic selling and retail panic, but without underlying bearish structure, the move tends to be exaggerated and quickly mean-reverts as liquidity providers and contrarian traders step in.",

      "Negative macro catalyst confirmed (news sentiment score < -0.7)",

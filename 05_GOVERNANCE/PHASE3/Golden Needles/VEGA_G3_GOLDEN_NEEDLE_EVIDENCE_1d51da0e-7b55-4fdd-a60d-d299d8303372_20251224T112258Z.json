    "statement": "In a NEUTRAL regime, a sharp sell-off (-1.5% to -3.5%) in the 2-hour window BEFORE the Asian trading session open (22:00-00:00 UTC) that finds support and fails to make a new low in the first 2 hours AFTER the Asian open (00:00-02:00 UTC) will lead to a mean-reverting bounce, capturing the majority of the pre-open drop within the next 6 hours.",
    "category": "TIMING",
    "rationale": "In neutral markets, pre-Asian open sell-offs are often low-liquidity 'hunting' moves. A failure to continue lower as Asian liquidity enters suggests a lack of genuine selling pressure, triggering short covering and opportunistic buying. The Asian session often provides a natural liquidity pool for reversal.",

    "statement": "Following a confirmed Fed liquidity injection (TGA drawdown > $10B in a week), crypto aggregate perpetual funding rates will compress to near-zero or negative for 3-5 days, after which a directional breakout (\u22655% move) in BTC will occur within the subsequent 48 hours, with the direction favoring the side of the prior regime trend.",
    "category": "TIMING",
    "rationale": "Fed liquidity initially reduces systemic stress and dampens speculative positioning (compressing funding). This creates a coiled spring. The subsequent breakout often resumes the underlying trend as new capital seeks direction. The October 'liquidity crash' created a structural low-volatility regime that may be prone to these injections.",

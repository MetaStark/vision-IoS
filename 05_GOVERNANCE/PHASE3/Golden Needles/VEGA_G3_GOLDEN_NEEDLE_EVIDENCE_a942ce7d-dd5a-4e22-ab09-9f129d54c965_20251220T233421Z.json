    "statement": "In a NEUTRAL regime (confidence > 55%), a positive CPI surprise (actual < consensus by \u2265 0.2%) will trigger a BTC price amplification of +3-5% within 24 hours, followed by a mean reversion fade of -1.5-2.5% over the subsequent 48 hours.",

    "rationale": "Neutral regimes lack strong directional bias, making them prone to overreaction to macro catalysts as traders search for direction. Positive inflation data directly impacts Fed policy expectations, a primary crypto macro driver. The initial surge is often amplified by liquidations and FOMO, but lacks the sustained buying pressure of a bull regime, leading to a predictable fade.",

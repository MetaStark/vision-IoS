    "title": "Negative Macro Catalyst Amplification in Neutral Regime",
    "statement": "In a NEUTRAL regime (confidence > 55%), a negative US macro catalyst (e.g., weak jobs report, high inflation print) will trigger a BTC price decline that is 1.8-2.5x larger than the average 4-hour move over the prior 5 days, with the majority of the drop occurring within 90 minutes of the news release.",
    "category": "CATALYST_AMPLIFICATION",
    "rationale": "Neutral regimes lack strong directional conviction, making prices more susceptible to external shocks. Recent news highlights job market concerns as a key macro catalyst. The market may overreact to negative data as participants re-assess risk in an uncertain environment, amplifying the initial move.",
    "entry_conditions": [
      "Regime = NEUTRAL (confidence > 55%)",
      "Scheduled US macro news release (NFP, CPI, PPI, FOMC) occurs",
      "News is interpreted as negative by consensus (e.g., unemployment rate increase > 0.2%, CPI MoM > 0.4%)",
      "BTC 5-minute candle immediately following news shows a 0.5% drop from pre-news price"

    "exit_conditions": {
      "take_profit": "Price reaches a level equal to (pre-news price) - (2.2 * average 4hr range of last 5 days)",
      "stop_loss": "Price reclaims the pre-news high (invalidates initial reaction)",
      "time_exit": "90 minutes after news release if neither TP nor SL hit"
    },
    "falsification_criteria": "In a NEUTRAL regime, negative macro catalysts consistently produce moves less than 1.5x the recent average volatility, or the initial reaction is quickly reversed (>70% retracement within 2 hours)."

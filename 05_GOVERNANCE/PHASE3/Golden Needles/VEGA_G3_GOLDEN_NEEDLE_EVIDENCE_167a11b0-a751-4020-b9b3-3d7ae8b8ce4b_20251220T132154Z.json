    "statement": "A NEUTRAL regime will transition to a BULL regime if, following a period of low volatility (20-day RV < 40%), BTC records two consecutive 'accumulation days'\u2014where price closes in the top 33% of its daily range AND daily volume is greater than the 10-day moving average volume. A long entry on the close of the second such day will capture the initial breakout phase.",

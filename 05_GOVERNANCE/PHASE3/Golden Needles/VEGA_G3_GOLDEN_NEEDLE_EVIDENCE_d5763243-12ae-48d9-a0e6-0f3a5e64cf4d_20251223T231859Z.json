    "title": "Post-News Volatility Compression Reversal",
    "statement": "Following a major crypto exchange news headline (e.g., liquidity provider announcement, regulatory update), if BTC's 1-hour realized volatility drops below its 24-hour rolling average by more than 30% within the 4-hour window post-news, a mean-reverting expansion in volatility and price movement will occur in the direction of the initial news sentiment within the next 6 hours.",
    "category": "TIMING",
    "rationale": "Major news creates initial volatility spike and positioning, followed by compression as market digests. The volatility compression below recent norms suggests suppressed movement that typically reverts as delayed participants react or initial overreaction corrects. The 4-hour window allows initial noise to settle while capturing the timing edge before broader market fully incorporates the news.",

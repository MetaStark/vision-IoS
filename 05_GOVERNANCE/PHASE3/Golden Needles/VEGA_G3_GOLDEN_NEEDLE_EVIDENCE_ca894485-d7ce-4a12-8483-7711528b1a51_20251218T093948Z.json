    "statement": "Following the announced end of Fed QT and $13.5B liquidity injection, a 3-day period of suppressed BTC 24h realized volatility (<35%) within the NEUTRAL regime will be followed by a directional breakout exceeding 2.5x the recent ATR within the next 5 trading days.",

    "rationale": "The end of quantitative tightening (QT) represents a structural shift in macro liquidity. Historically, such pivots precede asset reflation, but with a lag. The crypto market, post the 'October liquidity crash,' is in a fragile equilibrium. A period of low volatility (compression) after the news suggests absorption and positioning, creating a coiled spring setup. The concurrent growth in stablecoin supply provides the on-chain fuel for the move.",

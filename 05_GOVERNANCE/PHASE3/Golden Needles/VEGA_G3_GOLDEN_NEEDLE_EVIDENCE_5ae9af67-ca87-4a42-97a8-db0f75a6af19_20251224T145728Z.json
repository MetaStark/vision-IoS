    "title": "Post-ETF Flow Reversal Timing",
    "statement": "In NEUTRAL regimes, two consecutive days of net outflows from US Bitcoin ETFs (>$100M total) that occur without a corresponding >5% BTC price drop creates a contrarian long entry edge, with a rebound typically beginning within the next 36 hours.",
    "category": "TIMING",
    "rationale": "Significant ETF outflows in a neutral market that fail to drive price meaningfully lower suggest strong underlying bid absorption, likely from other institutional channels or long-term holders. This indicates the selling pressure is exhausted or being efficiently matched. The subsequent rebound is a timing play on the resumption of normal market function once the predictable ETF selling flow abates. Current news specifically mentions 'ETF outflows' amid a 'holiday lull', providing a relevant context.",

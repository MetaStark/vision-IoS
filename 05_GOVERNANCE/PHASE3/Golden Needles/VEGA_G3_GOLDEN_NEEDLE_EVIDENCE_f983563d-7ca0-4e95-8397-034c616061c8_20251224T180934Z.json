    "statement": "During NEUTRAL/BEAR regimes, when positive crypto news triggers a sharp intraday spike (>5% in 2 hours) in large-caps (BTC/ETH), but small-cap index (coins ranked 51-200) shows relative weakness (returns < 50% of BTC's), shorting small-caps relative to large-caps over next 24 hours yields alpha as liquidity flows back out after failed momentum transfer.",
    "category": "MOMENTUM",

    "statement": "During STRESS regimes, when BTC experiences a volatility breakout (daily close outside Bollinger Band \u00b12\u03c3) on elevated but declining volume (volume 20% above 20-day average but down 30% from previous day), the initial breakout direction will reverse within 3 trading days 70% of the time.",

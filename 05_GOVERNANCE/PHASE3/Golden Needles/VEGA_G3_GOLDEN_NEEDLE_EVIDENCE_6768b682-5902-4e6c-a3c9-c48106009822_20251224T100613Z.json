    "statement": "Following a period of significant miner capitulation (as indicated by a sharp drop in the Puell Multiple below 0.5), BTC price will experience a mean-reversion rally of at least 15% within the next 30 trading days, as selling pressure from distressed miners subsides and the market absorbs the supply shock.",

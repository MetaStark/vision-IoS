    "title": "Post-News Volatility Compression Reversal",
    "statement": "Following a high-impact news event (e.g., major regulatory announcement, CPI print, Fed speech), a sharp, high-volume price spike that fails to sustain momentum and is followed by 4 consecutive 15-minute candles with narrowing ranges (each high-low range < 70% of the spike candle's range) and declining volume (< 50% of spike volume) will lead to a mean-reverting move back through the volume-weighted average price (VWAP) of the spike candle within the next 2 hours.",
    "category": "TIMING",
    "rationale": "High-impact news often triggers emotional, liquidity-driven spikes that exhaust quickly. A subsequent pattern of narrowing ranges and drying volume suggests the initial reaction was overdone and momentum has collapsed, creating a high-probability setup for a reversion to the fair price established during the high-volume event (proxied by VWAP).",

      "Current price is >1.5% away from the VWAP of the initial spike candle"

      "take_profit": "Price crosses the VWAP of the initial spike candle",

    "falsification_criteria": "In a sample of 50+ qualifying events, the mean-reversion to spike VWAP occurs in < 55% of cases within the 2-hour window, or the average win from successful trades does not exceed 1.25x the average loss."

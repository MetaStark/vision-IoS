    "statement": "When BTC 20-day realized volatility falls below its 60-day rolling 20th percentile (compression) while the BTC 1-month 25-delta skew remains neutral (between -5 and +5), a subsequent 5% price move in either direction within 3 days will initiate a sustained trend in that direction for the next 10 trading days, with the trend continuation probability exceeding 65%.",

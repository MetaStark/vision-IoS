    "statement": "During a BEAR regime, if the 14-day RSI on BTC makes a higher low while price makes a lower low (bullish divergence), concurrently with the Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) metric dipping into the 'Capituation' zone (<0) and the 30-day mean of Exchange Net Flow turning negative (sustained accumulation), a daily close above the 7-day high will signal a transition to a NEUTRAL regime.",
    "category": "REGIME_EDGE",
    "rationale": "Bear regimes end with seller exhaustion. Bullish RSI divergence indicates weakening downward momentum. NUPL in capitulation suggests maximal pain/disbelief. Sustained negative exchange flow indicates strong hands are absorbing supply off-exchange. A break above a near-term high confirms a shift in short-term market structure, often the first step toward stabilization (NEUTRAL).",

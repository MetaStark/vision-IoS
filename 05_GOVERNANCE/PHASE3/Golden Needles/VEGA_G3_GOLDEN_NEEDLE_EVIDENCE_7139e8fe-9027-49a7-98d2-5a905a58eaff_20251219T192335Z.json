    "title": "ETF Flow Reversal Amplification After Large Outflows",
    "statement": "Following a cluster of large Bitcoin ETF outflows (>$500M cumulative over 3 days) that coincide with a neutral-to-bearish price reaction (down less than 5%), the subsequent 2-day period will see amplified inflows and a price rebound of 1.8-3.0x the magnitude of the initial outflow-driven decline, as tactical capital re-enters at perceived value.",
    "category": "MOMENTUM",
    "rationale": "Large but orderly ETF outflows in a bull/neutral regime often represent profit-taking or rotation rather than loss of conviction. When price holds relatively firm, it signals underlying demand. The reversal is amplified by short covering, institutional rebalancing, and FOMO from sidelined capital.",
    "entry_conditions": [
      "U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs net outflows >$500M over 3 consecutive days",
      "BTC price decline during outflow period is <5% (shows resilience)",
      "Cumulative volume during outflow days is >1.5x 20-day average",
      "ETF premium/discount to NAV narrows to within -0.3% to +0.2% by end of outflow period"

      "take_profit": "Price rebounds to 2.2x the magnitude of the outflow-period decline (from entry)",

      "time_exit": "5 trading days after entry"

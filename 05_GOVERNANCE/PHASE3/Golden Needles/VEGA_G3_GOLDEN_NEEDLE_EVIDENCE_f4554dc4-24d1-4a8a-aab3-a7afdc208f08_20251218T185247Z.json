    "statement": "When 'mysterious trader' selling narratives emerge during neutral regimes and price declines 2-4% on elevated volume, entering long positions after the third consecutive 4-hour candle of declining volume (while price stabilizes) captures the exhaustion of informed selling pressure.",

    "statement": "Following the Binance 20% APR offer announcement for USD1, low-float tokens with similar high-staking yield narratives will experience amplified, short-term price surges (15-25%) within 48 hours, driven by retail flow seeking the next high-yield opportunity, before mean-reverting.",
    "category": "CATALYST_AMPLIFICATION",
    "rationale": "The USD1 surge demonstrates intense retail demand for high nominal yields in a low-rate crypto environment. This creates a 'playbook' catalyst where traders immediately scan for similar narratives. Low-float tokens are susceptible to amplified moves due to limited sell-side liquidity. The effect is transient as it's driven by momentum speculation, not sustainable fundamentals.",

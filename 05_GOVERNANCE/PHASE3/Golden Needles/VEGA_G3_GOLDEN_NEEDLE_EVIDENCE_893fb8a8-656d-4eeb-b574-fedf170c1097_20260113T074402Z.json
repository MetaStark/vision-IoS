    "title": "Neutral-to-Bear Regime Fade on Failed High-Volatility Breakout",
    "statement": "When the market is in a NEUTRAL regime (confidence > 90%) and experiences a sharp, high-volume price spike (>2.5x 20-day average volume) that fails to sustain above a key resistance level (e.g., prior local high + 1 ATR), a rapid mean reversion to the pre-spike range will occur within 3 trading days, signaling an early transition to a BEAR regime.",
    "category": "REGIME_EDGE",
    "rationale": "Neutral regimes are characterized by range-bound price action and low conviction. A high-volume breakout attempt that immediately fails suggests exhaustion of buying pressure and latent selling interest, often preceding a bearish shift. The rapid rejection indicates weak follow-through.",
    "entry_conditions": [
      "Current regime == NEUTRAL with confidence > 90%",
      "BTC 4h close makes new 7-day high on volume > 2.5x 20-day average",

      "take_profit": "Price retraces 61.8% of the spike move OR touches the 20-period SMA on 4h chart",

      "time_exit": "3 trading days (18 4h candles) after entry"

    "falsification_criteria": "More than 40% of such failed breakouts lead to a successful breakout above the spike high within 5 days, or the subsequent retracement fails to exceed 38.2% of the spike move."

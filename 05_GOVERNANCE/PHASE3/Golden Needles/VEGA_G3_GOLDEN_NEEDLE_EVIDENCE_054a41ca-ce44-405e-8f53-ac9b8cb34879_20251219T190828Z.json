    "title": "Asymmetric ETF Flow Amplification in Neutral Regime",
    "statement": "In a NEUTRAL regime (VIX < 20, BTC 20-day volatility < 50%), the first significant daily net inflow (>$200M) or outflow (>$150M) to US Spot Bitcoin ETFs after a 3-day period of sub-$50M net flows will trigger a disproportionate, multi-day price move that is 3-5x larger than the flow's implied instantaneous buying/selling pressure.",
    "category": "CROSS_ASSET",
    "rationale": "Neutral regimes are characterized by low conviction and low liquidity provision. A large, discrete ETF flow acts as a high-signal catalyst that breaks the indecision. Market makers, anticipating follow-on flows and trend-follower reaction, re-price aggressively, creating momentum that far exceeds the simple dollar-for-dollar impact of the flow itself.",

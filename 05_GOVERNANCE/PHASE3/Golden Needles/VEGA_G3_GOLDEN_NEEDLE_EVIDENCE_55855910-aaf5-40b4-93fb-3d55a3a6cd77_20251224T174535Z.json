    "title": "BTC Volatility Compression Breakout with Options Expiry Catalyst",
    "statement": "BTC's current consolidation between $85k-$90k, coupled with the imminent options expiry, creates a high-probability setup for a directional breakout. A close above $90,500 on increasing volume (>20% above 20-day average) will signal a bullish breakout targeting $94k, while a close below $84,800 on high volume will signal a bearish breakdown targeting $81.5k.",

    "rationale": "Options expiry events often catalyze breakouts from compression ranges as large positions are rolled or closed.

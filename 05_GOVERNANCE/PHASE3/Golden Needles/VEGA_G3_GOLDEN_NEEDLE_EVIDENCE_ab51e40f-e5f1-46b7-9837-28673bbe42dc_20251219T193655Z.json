    "statement": "During a BULL regime, if BTC breaks above the previous day's high during the Asian trading session (00:00 - 08:00 UTC) on low relative volume (<80% of the prior 5-session average for that window), price will pull back to retest the breakout level within the next 12 hours, offering a high-probability long entry.",

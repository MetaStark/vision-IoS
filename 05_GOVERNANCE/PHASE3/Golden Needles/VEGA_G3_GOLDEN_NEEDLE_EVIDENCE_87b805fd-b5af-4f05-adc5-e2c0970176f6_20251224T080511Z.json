    "statement": "In a NEUTRAL/BEAR regime, when BTC rallies intraday to touch or exceed its 50-day MA but closes near the low of the day (lower 25% of daily range) on above-average volume (>1.2x 20-day avg), it signals a failed breakout and predicts negative momentum for the next 2 days.",
    "category": "MOMENTUM",
    "rationale": "A rejection at a key moving average (50-day MA) with weak closing price and high volume indicates strong selling pressure and exhaustion of buying momentum.

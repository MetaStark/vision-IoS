    "statement": "During a STRESS regime, the appearance of a large downside gap (open >2.5% below prior close) that is partially filled within the same trading day (price trades above the midpoint of the gap) indicates panic exhaustion and presents a high-risk, high-reward mean reversion trade back towards the pre-gap close.",
    "category": "REGIME_EDGE",
    "rationale": "Stress regimes are characterized by panic and illiquidity. A large gap represents an overnight sentiment extreme. A rapid intraday recovery of half the gap suggests the panic was overdone and met with aggressive buying (e.g., short covering, contrarian bids), providing a short-term snap-back opportunity. This is a pure liquidity-driven reversal.",

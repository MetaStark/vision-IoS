    "statement": "During a STRESS regime triggered by traditional market contagion (high correlation with SPX), a decoupling event where the 5-day rolling correlation between BTC daily returns and SPX daily returns drops from above +0.6 to below 0 within 3 days, while BTC's price holds above the weekly open, signals the STRESS regime is resolving, likely reverting to NEUTRAL or prior trend.",
    "category": "CROSS_ASSET",

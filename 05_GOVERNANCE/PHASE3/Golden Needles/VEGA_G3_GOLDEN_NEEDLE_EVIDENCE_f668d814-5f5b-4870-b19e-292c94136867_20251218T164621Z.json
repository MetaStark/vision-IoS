    "title": "Liquidation Cascade Reversal Fade",
    "statement": "A sharp, high-volume price drop (>8% in <2 hours for BTC) triggered by a cascade of long liquidations (>$300M in 24h) will be followed by an exaggerated but transient rebound. This 'dead cat bounce' will fail to reclaim a key technical level (prior 4H support turned resistance) and present a high-probability short entry.",
    "category": "MEAN_REVERSION",
    "rationale": "Liquidation cascades are driven by forced selling, not fundamental re-assessment. The violent move often exhausts immediate sellers. The subsequent rebound is fueled by opportunistic dip-buying and short covering, but the underlying weak structure and damaged sentiment remain, leading to a failure at a logical technical level before a retest of lows.",
    "entry_conditions": [
      "BTC drops >8% within 2 hours on volume >150% of 20-day average",
      "24H total crypto long liquidations exceed $300M",

      "1-hour candle shows rejection at this level (upper wick > body) with declining volume on the approach"

    "exit_conditions": {
      "take_profit": "Move down to within 1% of the initial cascade low",
      "stop_loss": "1-hour close >3% above the identified resistance level",
      "time_exit": "36 hours after entry"
    },
    "falsification_criteria": "In >55% of cases, the rebound after such a liquidation cascade continues beyond the key resistance level and sustains, indicating a true V-shaped recovery rather than a fade opportunity."

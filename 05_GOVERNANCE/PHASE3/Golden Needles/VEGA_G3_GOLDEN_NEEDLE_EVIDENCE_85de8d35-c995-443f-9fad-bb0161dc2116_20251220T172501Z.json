    "title": "Post-News Volatility Compression Breakout",
    "statement": "Following a significant, high-impact news event (e.g., CPI, Fed decision, major ETF flow report), a subsequent period of low realized volatility (< 15% annualized over 4 hours) within 24 hours of the event will be followed by a directional move exceeding 1.5x the initial news-driven price range.",
    "category": "VOLATILITY",
    "rationale": "Major catalysts create information asymmetry and repositioning. A rapid compression after the initial reaction suggests temporary equilibrium before a second wave of orders from slower participants or algorithmic momentum strategies executes, amplifying the original catalyst's directional bias.",
    "entry_conditions": [
      "High-impact news event occurs (identified via news sentiment score > 0.8 or < -0.8).",
      "Post-news, 4-hour realized volatility drops below 15% annualized while price remains within +/- 0.5% of the post-news settlement price.",
      "BTC 1-hour RSI crosses above 55 (for long) or below 45 (for short), confirming the initial breakout direction from the compression range."
    ],
    "exit_conditions": {
      "take_profit": "Price move equals 1.5x the absolute size of the initial news-driven hourly candle.",
      "stop_loss": "Price reverses to breach the opposite side of the 4-hour compression range by 0.3%.",
      "time_exit": "24 hours after entry if neither TP nor SL is hit."
    },
    "falsification_criteria": "More than 55% of such setups result in a false breakout (price re-entering the compression range before hitting TP) or a move that fails to reach 1.0x the initial news range."

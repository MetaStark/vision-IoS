    "statement": "When a significant negative catalyst (e.g., 'scarier macro catalyst' headline) causes a >5% BTC price decline, but the next day's US spot Bitcoin ETF flows are net positive (>+$100M), the price will recover the entire previous day's loss within the subsequent 48 trading hours, outperforming a simple mean reversion baseline.",
    "category": "TIMING",
    "rationale": "This tests whether institutional ETF buying is a stronger force than retail/news-driven selling. Positive flows amidst negative news indicate institutional conviction and dip-buying, which can overwhelm the initial catalyst's sentiment. The entry timing aligns flow data with the next liquidity window.",

    "falsification_criteria": "Positive ETF flows following a negative-news drop fail to catalyze a full recovery more than 50% of the time, indicating the selling pressure from the catalyst is more persistent or that ETF flows are not a timely leading indicator."

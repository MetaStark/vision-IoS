    "statement": "When BTC experiences concurrent negative catalysts (e.g., large liquidations + macro fears + break of key support), and the 1-hour funding rate turns significantly negative (< -0.02%), a short-squeeze rally of 3-5% will occur within the next 6-8 hours as excessive bearish positioning is unwound.",

A break of key support can be a 'sell the rumor, buy the news' event if the break fails to accelerate. The current setup with liquidations, macro fears, and a break of $85K fits.",

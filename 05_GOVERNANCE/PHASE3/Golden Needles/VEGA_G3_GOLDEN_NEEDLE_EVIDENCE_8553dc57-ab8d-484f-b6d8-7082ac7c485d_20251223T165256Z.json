    "title": "Post-News Momentum Fade in Neutral Regime",
    "statement": "In a NEUTRAL regime, a sharp, high-volume price spike (>3% in 4 hours) driven by a negative news headline (e.g., 'Bitcoin Decline', 'Momentum Wanes') will be followed by a momentum fade and a retracement of at least 50% of the initial spike within the next 24 hours, providing a short-term mean-reversion opportunity.",
    "category": "MOMENTUM",
    "rationale": "In a neutral regime lacking strong directional conviction, extreme moves driven by sentiment/news are often overreactions. The 'little optimism' and 'momentum wanes' narrative suggests a fragile market prone to quick profit-taking on any rallies and covering on sharp sell-offs, leading to a fade.",
    "entry_conditions": [
      "Regime Confidence: NEUTRAL > 60%",
      "BTC or ETH experiences a >3% price move (up or down) within a 4-hour candle on volume >1.5x 20-period average",
      "The move coincides with a timestamp of a major negative news headline from a top-5 crypto news source",
      "Enter on the close of the 1-hour candle following the initial spike candle, in the direction opposite the spike (i.e., short if spike up, long if spike down)."

    "exit_conditions": {
      "take_profit": "Price retraces 50% of the initial spike's range (high-low).",
      "stop_loss": "Price moves beyond the high/low of the initial spike candle by 0.5%.",
      "time_exit": "24 hours after entry."
    },
    "falsification_criteria": "If >55% of such identified spikes in a NEUTRAL regime continue in their initial direction for more than 24 hours, exceeding the spike high/low by >1%, the hypothesis is falsified."

    "title": "Volatility Compression Breakout Asymmetry",
    "statement": "Following a period of low volatility (BTC 20-day realized volatility < 30%) within a NEUTRAL regime, a breakout above the 20-day Bollinger Band (2 std) on expanding volume (>1.5x 20-day average) will lead to a sustained directional move with higher momentum continuation probability than a breakdown below the lower band.",
    "category": "VOLATILITY",
    "rationale": "In neutral regimes, prolonged low volatility often represents accumulation/consolidation. Breakouts on high volume from such compression tend to attract momentum flows as trapped positions are forced to react. Upside breakouts have shown stronger follow-through historically due to asymmetric positioning (more traders willing to chase rallies than sell-offs in neutral environments).",

      "BTC 20-day realized volatility < 30% for at least 5 consecutive days",
      "Regime == NEUTRAL (confidence > 60%)",

      "stop_loss": "Price closes back inside Bollinger Bands",
      "time_exit": "7 days after entry if neither TP nor SL hit"
    },
    "falsification_criteria": "If upside breakouts from low-vol neutral periods fail more than 55% of the time within 3 days (close back inside bands) OR if downside breakouts show equal or better momentum continuation."

    "statement": "Following a sharp, catalyst-driven sell-off (>8% in <6 hours) that pushes the market into a STRESS regime, the first 2-hour period where the 5-minute realized volatility drops below 50% of its peak during the sell-off will precede a strong, but short-lived, technical rebound of 3-6% as exhausted sellers pause and opportunistic liquidity provision enters.",
    "category": "REGIME_EDGE",
    "rationale": "Violent, catalyst-driven sell-offs exhaust immediate selling pressure and create a liquidity vacuum. The drop in short-term volatility signals a pause in panic. This attracts short-term mean reversion traders, high-frequency liquidity providers, and profit-taking from shorts, creating a predictable but fragile rebound. The catalyst creates the oversold condition and the volatility signal provides the timing edge.",

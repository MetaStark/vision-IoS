    "title": "Post-News Volatility Compression Breakout",
    "statement": "When a major negative news catalyst (e.g., regulatory, macro) causes a sharp 1-hour price drop (>3%) on elevated volume (>1.5x 20-day avg), but the subsequent 4-hour candle closes within the top 25% of its range, the initial sell-off is likely exhausted. A long entry on a break above the high of that 4-hour candle will capture a short-covering rally amplified by trapped shorts and algorithmic momentum ignition.",
    "category": "CATALYST_AMPLIFICATION",
    "rationale": "Sharp, news-driven drops often flush out weak hands and trigger stop-loss cascades. A quick recovery (high-range close) indicates strong absorption of selling. This creates a 'bear trap,' where late shorts are vulnerable. A break above the consolidation high triggers covering and attracts momentum algorithms, amplifying the move.",

      "1-hour BTC candle closes down >3% on volume >1.5x 20-day average",
      "Trigger: Next 4-hour candle closes with a close price in the top 25% of its range (High - Low)",

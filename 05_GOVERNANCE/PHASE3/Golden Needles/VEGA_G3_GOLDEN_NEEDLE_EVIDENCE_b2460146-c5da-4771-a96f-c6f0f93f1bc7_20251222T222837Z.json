    "title": "Neutral-to-Bear Regime Fade on Failed Volatility Breakout",
    "statement": "In a NEUTRAL regime, a sharp, high-volume price breakout (>2.5% move) that fails to hold above its 20-period Bollinger Band (2 std) and is accompanied by a divergence in the RSI (price makes a higher high, RSI makes a lower high) will be followed by a mean reversion move back into the prior range and a high probability transition to a BEAR regime within 5 days.",
    "category": "REGIME_EDGE",
    "rationale": "In neutral, range-bound markets, liquidity-driven breakouts often fail. A failure at a technical extreme (Bollinger Band) with weakening momentum (RSI divergence) suggests exhaustion among breakout buyers. This creates a 'trap' scenario where late longs are forced to exit, driving price back into the range and potentially catalyzing a shift in market structure toward a bearish bias, especially if macro/news catalysts (like regulatory headlines) are present but not yet price-destructive.",
    "entry_conditions": [
      "Current regime is NEUTRAL (confidence > 60%)",
      "BTC/USD makes a >2.5% intraday move on volume >120% of 20-day average",
      "Price closes outside the 20-period, 2-standard deviation Bollinger Band",
      "On the subsequent 4-hour candle, price closes back inside the Bollinger Band",
      "4-hour RSI (14) shows bearish divergence (price high > prior high, RSI high < prior high)"

    "exit_conditions": {
      "take_profit": "Price retraces 61.8% of the initial breakout move OR regime model shifts to BEAR (confidence > 65%)",
      "stop_loss": "Price closes >2% above the high of the initial breakout candle",
      "time_exit": "5 days after entry without a regime shift to BEAR"
    },
    "falsification_criteria": "More than 40% of such signals are followed by a continuation of the breakout move and a transition to a BULL regime instead."

    "title": "Negative Funding Catalyst Momentum Flip",
    "statement": "During a neutral/bear regime, if perpetual swap funding rates turn deeply negative (< -0.03% per 8hr) while price is in a downtrend, a short-squeeze catalyst (e.g., positive news headline) will trigger an amplified reversal rally that retraces 50-61.8% of the prior 3-day decline.",
    "category": "MOMENTUM",
    "rationale": "Deep negative funding indicates extreme short positioning and leverage. The market is primed for a squeeze. A catalyst acts as a spark, forcing shorts to cover. This covering creates reflexive buying pressure, amplifying the initial catalyst move beyond its intrinsic news value. The Fibonacci target is a common technical magnet for counter-trend moves.",

    "title": "Post-News Volatility Compression Breakout",
    "statement": "When BTC experiences a >5% intraday drop on high negative sentiment news (e.g., ETF outflows, macro catalyst), followed by a 4-hour compression period (Bollinger Band Width < 0.5), the subsequent breakout in the direction of the initial drop will extend by an additional 3-5% within 12 hours as delayed reactions and stop-loss cascades amplify the move.",
    "category": "VOLATILITY",
    "rationale": "Sharp negative moves on concrete news often trigger an initial wave of selling, followed by a consolidation as weak hands exit. The compression represents a temporary equilibrium before a second wave of selling from momentum traders and triggered stops amplifies the original catalyst. The 4-hour filter ensures the move isn't immediately reversed.",

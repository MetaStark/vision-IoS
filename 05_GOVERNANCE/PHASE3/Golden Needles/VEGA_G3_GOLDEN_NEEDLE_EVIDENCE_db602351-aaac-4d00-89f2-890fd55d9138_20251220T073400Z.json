    "statement": "Following a major CPI print that causes a sharp intraday whipsaw (>\u00b13% BTC move within 2 hours) but closes within \u00b11% of pre-announcement price, the subsequent 24-hour period will exhibit amplified directional momentum in the direction of the initial post-announcement spike, as trapped liquidity and stop-loss cascades are triggered.",
    "category": "TIMING",

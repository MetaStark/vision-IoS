    "statement": "Positive regulatory news headlines (e.g., 'Crypto Market Structure Bill Gains Momentum') that generate a +3% to +6% BTC price gap up at the daily open will be partially filled (-50% to -70% of the gap) within the same trading day, as momentum chasers are met with sell-side liquidity from pre-news holders.",
    "category": "MOMENTUM",
    "rationale": "In a NEUTRAL regime, strong positive news often triggers a knee-jerk rally that lacks the sustained buying to hold the gap. Sellers use the liquidity event to exit.

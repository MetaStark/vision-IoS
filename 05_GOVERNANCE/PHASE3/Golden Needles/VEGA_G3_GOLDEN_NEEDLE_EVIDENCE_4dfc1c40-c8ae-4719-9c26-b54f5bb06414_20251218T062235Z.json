    "statement": "When BTC trades within a 5-day Bollinger Band width percentile below 20% (compression) during a NEUTRAL regime, a daily close above the 20-day upper Bollinger Band with volume exceeding its 20-day average by 50% signals a high-probability directional breakout that persists for at least 3 days.",

The NEUTRAL regime filter avoids false breakouts during high-volatility stress periods.",

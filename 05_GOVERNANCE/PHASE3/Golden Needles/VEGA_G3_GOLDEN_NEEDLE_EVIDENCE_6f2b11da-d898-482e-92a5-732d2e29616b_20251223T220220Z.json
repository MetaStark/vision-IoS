    "title": "Political Memecoin Volatility Compression Breakout",
    "statement": "During NEUTRAL/BULL regimes with elevated social volume around political events (e.g., elections, debates), a significant compression in the 7-day realized volatility of political memecoins (e.g., TRUMP, BODEN) below their 30-day 20th percentile, followed by a +5% move in BTC, will trigger a sharp volatility expansion in those memecoins, outperforming generic memecoins.",
    "category": "VOLATILITY",
    "rationale": "Political memecoins trade on narrative and attention, which is currently high per news cycle. During calm markets, they can become dormant. A sharp move in BTC shakes out complacency and redirects speculative capital. Political narratives provide a focused channel for that capital, causing outsized moves in these low-float, high-narrative tokens.",

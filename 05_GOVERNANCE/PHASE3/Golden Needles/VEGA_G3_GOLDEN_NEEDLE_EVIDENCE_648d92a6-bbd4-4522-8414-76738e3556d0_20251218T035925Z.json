    "statement": "When a significant negative news catalyst (e.g., large liquidation event, regulatory headline) causes a sharp 1-hour price drop (>3%) on elevated volume (>150% of 20-day avg) in a NEUTRAL regime, the subsequent 4-hour period will exhibit a mean-reverting bounce of at least 50% of the initial drop, as panic selling exhausts and algorithmic buyers step in.",
    "category": "CATALYST_AMPLIFICATION",

      "BTC 1-hour candle closes down >3% on volume >150% of 20-day average",
      "Catalyst identified (news headline, liquidation spike >$200M)",

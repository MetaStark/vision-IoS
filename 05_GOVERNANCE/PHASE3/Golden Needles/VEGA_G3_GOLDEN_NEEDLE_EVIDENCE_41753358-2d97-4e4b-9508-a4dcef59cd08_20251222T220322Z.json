    "title": "Post-News Volatility Compression Reversal",
    "statement": "Following a high-impact news event (e.g., CPI, FOMC) that causes a sharp, high-volume spike (>2x 20-day average) in BTC price but closes within the prior day's range, the market will experience a directional reversal within the next 24 hours as the initial emotional reaction fades and structural flows reassert themselves.",
    "category": "TIMING",
    "rationale": "High-impact news often triggers knee-jerk reactions from algos and retail. An 'inside day' close suggests the move lacked conviction. The subsequent session often sees a reversion as liquidity providers fade the extreme and positioning normalizes. This is less effective in STRESS regimes where follow-through is more common.",
    "entry_conditions": [
      "BTC experiences a >3% intraday move on news with volume >2x 20-day average.",
      "The daily candle closes within the high/low range of the previous trading day (an 'inside day' pattern).",
      "The 1-hour RSI(14) after the close is >70 (for a short entry) or <30 (for a long entry), indicating an extreme from the spike."

      "stop_loss": "1.5% price move in the direction of the initial spike (beyond the spike's extreme).",

    "title": "Pre-Weekend Liquidity Drain Momentum",
    "statement": "In NEUTRAL or BULL regimes, a sustained price move (min 1.2% over 2 hours) that begins in the final 3 hours of the Friday (UTC) trading week will continue in the same direction for the first 2-4 hours of Saturday (UTC) with reduced volatility but high consistency, as weekend liquidity drain amplifies the last institutional bias of the week.",
    "category": "TIMING",
    "rationale": "The final hours of Friday often see the last batch of institutional/weekly positioning adjustments. As liquidity providers and market makers reduce activity for the weekend, the market becomes 'sticky' and prone to drift in the direction of the last committed flows, with fewer participants to provide counter-trading liquidity.",
    "entry_conditions": [
      "Regime is NEUTRAL or BULL (per FjordHQ regime filter)",
      "Friday (UTC): Price has a clear, sustained 2-hour move > 1.2% between 18:00 - 24:00 UTC",
      "Move is not a violent reversal but a continuation or new trend",
      "Enter in direction of move within last 30 minutes of Friday UTC or first 30 minutes of Saturday UTC",

    },
    "falsification_criteria": "The Saturday continuation fails to materialize (>50% of time, move stalls or reverses immediately at weekend open), suggesting weekend liquidity is sufficient to absorb Friday's flows or that the Friday move was purely speculative and unwound immediately."

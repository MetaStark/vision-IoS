    "title": "Post-News Volatility Compression Breakout",
    "statement": "Following a significant negative news catalyst (e.g., major exchange hack, regulatory crackdown headline) that causes a sharp, high-volume price drop (>3% within 2 hours), the subsequent 24-hour period will exhibit amplified directional momentum in the *opposite* direction of the initial spike as over-leveraged positions are cleared and the market reassesses the actual impact.",
    "category": "CATALYST_AMPLIFICATION",
    "rationale": "Sharp, news-driven sell-offs often force liquidations and trap late shorts. Once the emotional selling exhausts and the news is digested (often found to be less severe than initial headlines), a swift reversal occurs. The consolidation period filters for exhaustion before the reversal leg.",

      "BTC 2-hour candle closes >3% below previous close on volume >150% of 20-period average",
      "Candle coincides with a surge in negative news sentiment score (external data feed) >2 standard deviations above mean",

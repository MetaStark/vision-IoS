    "title": "Negative News Amplification in Low-Liquidity Windows",
    "statement": "Negative macro or crypto-specific news released during Asian trading hours (00:00-08:00 UTC) triggers an initial sell-off that is amplified by 30-50% more than the same news released during US/European hours, due to lower spot liquidity and reduced algorithmic buying support.",
    "category": "TIMING",
    "rationale": "Asian hours typically have thinner order books and less institutional algorithmic buying (e.g., from US-based quant funds/market makers). Negative news triggers stop-loss cascades and long liquidations that meet less buy-side absorption, leading to exaggerated downside moves. The negative funding rate confirms leveraged long pain.",

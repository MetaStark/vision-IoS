    "statement": "When a technical breakdown (e.g., loss of key support) coincides with a negative on-chain/metric catalyst (e.g., exchange net inflows, negative funding) within a 2-hour window, the resulting downward move will be amplified, exceeding the magnitude predicted by either catalyst alone by a factor of 1.8-2.5.",

    "rationale": "Technical traders act on the breakdown. Concurrent on-chain/metric deterioration provides fundamental/flow confirmation, activating a different cohort of sellers (long-term holders, institutional models). This multi-cohort selling creates amplified, cascading pressure as stops are hit and sentiment rapidly deteriorates.",

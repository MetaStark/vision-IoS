    "statement": "When Bitcoin experiences consecutive days of ETF net outflows (>$200M cumulative over 3 days) during a NEUTRAL/BULL regime, the subsequent first day of net inflows (>$100M) will trigger a disproportionate price rally of 1.8-2.5x the inflow amount's expected impact, as short-term bears are forced to cover.",

    "rationale": "Sustained ETF outflows create bearish sentiment and short positioning. When flows reverse, it signals institutional re-accumulation, forcing shorts to cover. The amplification comes from both the actual buying pressure AND the short squeeze component. Current market shows this dynamic with recent $600M liquidations hiding larger macro catalysts.",

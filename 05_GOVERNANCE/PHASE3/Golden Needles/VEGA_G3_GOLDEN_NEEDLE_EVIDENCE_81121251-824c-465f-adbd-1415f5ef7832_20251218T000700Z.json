  "hypothesis_content": {
    "title": "Intraday V-Shaped Reversion After 15-Minute Flash Move",
    "statement": "A rapid, high-volume price move in BTC exceeding 1.8% within a 15-minute candle, without a corresponding major news catalyst, will revert by at least 50% of the initial move within the next 90 minutes, regardless of regime.",
    "category": "MEAN_REVERSION",
    "rationale": "Flash moves are often caused by large market orders or stop hunts that exhaust immediate liquidity. The absence of fundamental news suggests the move is technical and temporary. High volume confirms genuine participation, increasing the likelihood of a swift reversal as liquidity replenishes.",
    "entry_conditions": [
      "BTC 15-minute candle absolute return > 1.8%",
      "Candle volume > 1.5x 20-period average volume",
      "No major scheduled news (Fed, CPI, exchange outage) within +/- 30 minutes",
      "Enter at the open of the next 15-minute candle, in the direction opposite the flash move"
    ],
    "exit_conditions": {
      "take_profit": "Price retraces 50% of the initial 1.8%+ flash move",
      "stop_loss": "Price moves an additional 0.9% against the entry (beyond the flash move extreme)",
      "time_exit": "90 minutes after entry"
    },
    "falsification_criteria": "The 50% retracement occurs in less than 40% of qualifying events, or the average retracement is less than 30% of the initial move. If performance differs significantly by regime (e.g., works in NEUTRAL but fails in STRESS), the 'regardless of regime' claim is falsified."

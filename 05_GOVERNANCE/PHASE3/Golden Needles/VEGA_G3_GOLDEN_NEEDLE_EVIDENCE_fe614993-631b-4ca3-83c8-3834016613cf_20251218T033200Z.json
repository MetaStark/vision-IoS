    "title": "Neutral-to-Bull Transition on Consecutive Accumulation Closes",
    "statement": "During a NEUTRAL regime, if BTC closes above its 20-day volume-weighted average price (VWAP) for 5 consecutive days, with each day's close in the top 60% of its daily range and declining exchange balances (\u2265 -5k BTC net outflow over the period), the regime is transitioning to BULL. A long entry on a pullback to the 20-day VWAP will be profitable.",
    "category": "REGIME_EDGE",
    "rationale": "Consecutive strong closes above VWAP indicate persistent buying pressure. Closing in the top of the daily range shows buyers are in control by session end. Concurrent exchange outflows suggest accumulation and withdrawal to cold storage, reducing immediate sell-side liquidity. This combination is a reliable precursor to a BULL regime as supply tightens and demand manifests.",

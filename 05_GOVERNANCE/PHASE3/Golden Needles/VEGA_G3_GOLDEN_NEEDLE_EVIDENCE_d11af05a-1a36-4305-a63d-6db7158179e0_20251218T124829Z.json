    "statement": "In a NEUTRAL regime, a sharp 1-hour price spike (>1.5%) on low relative volume (< 80% of 20-period average) that fails to sustain a break above the prior session's high will reverse fully within the next 4 hours, providing a short-term mean-reversion opportunity.",
    "category": "MOMENTUM",
    "rationale": "Neutral regimes are characterized by range-bound action and a lack of sustained directional conviction. A low-volume spike that fails is a classic sign of a 'stop hunt' or weak speculative push, not genuine buying pressure. The market is likely to quickly reject this move, snapping back into the established range.",

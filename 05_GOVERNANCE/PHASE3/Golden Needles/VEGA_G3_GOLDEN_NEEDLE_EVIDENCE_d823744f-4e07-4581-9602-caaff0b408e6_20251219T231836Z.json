    "title": "Post-News Volatility Compression Reversal",
    "statement": "Following a high-impact news event (e.g., major policy speech, CPI release), a sharp, high-volume spike in BTC volatility (1-min ATR > 5x 15-min rolling average) that fails to sustain for more than 15 minutes and is followed by a 30-minute period of declining volume and compressed price range (< 50% of the spike range) will lead to a mean-reverting move in the opposite direction of the initial spike over the next 2-4 hours.",
    "category": "TIMING",
    "rationale": "High-impact news often triggers knee-jerk, liquidity-driven moves by algos and emotional traders. If the move lacks follow-through (declining volume, compression), it suggests the initial reaction may have been overdone. The subsequent break of the compression range often traps late momentum traders and triggers a reversal as initial positions are unwound.",

      "Spike fails to sustain: price returns within 50% of pre-spike range within 15 mins",
      "Subsequent 30-min period shows declining volume (each 5-min bar lower than previous) and price range compression (range < 50% of initial spike range)",
      "Enter on a break of the high/low of the 30-minute compression candle, in the direction OPPOSITE the initial news spike."

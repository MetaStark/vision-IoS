    "statement": "When a significant negative macro catalyst (e.g., regulatory, inflation) triggers a sharp, high-volume sell-off in BTC (>5% drop in <4 hours), the subsequent 24-hour period will see a mean-reverting bounce of at least 50% of the initial drop, as panic selling exhausts and algorithmic buyers step in at perceived oversold levels.",

    "title": "FOMC Dovish Pivot Amplification in Perp Funding",
    "statement": "A confirmed dovish pivot by the Fed (e.g., shift to explicit easing bias, unexpected rate cut) will be initially met with a sharp, bullish price reaction in BTC. This catalyst will then be amplified in the derivatives market, causing an extreme and sustained shift to positive funding rates (> +50% annualized) across major perpetual swap exchanges for a period of 24-72 hours, creating a high-probability mean reversion short opportunity in BTC perps once funding peaks.",
    "category": "CATALYST_AMPLIFICATION",
    "rationale": "A major macro catalyst triggers a violent repositioning. The initial price move forces shorts to cover and entices leveraged longs, pushing funding to unsustainable extremes. The catalyst's initial effect is amplified by reflexive derivatives dynamics. Once the initial frenzy subsides, the extreme cost of holding longs (high funding) acts as a friction that catalyzes the *opposite* move\u2014a liquidation of over-leveraged positions, making the funding rate itself a leading indicator for a short-term pullback.",

      "Aggregate perpetual swap funding rate across Binance, Bybit, OKX rises above +0.015% per 8h (+50%+ annualized) and sustains above that level for two consecutive 8h periods.",

    "title": "Volatility Spike Decay in Neutral Regime (VIX of Crypto Signal)",
    "statement": "In a NEUTRAL regime (as currently identified), when the 1-day realized volatility of BTC spikes above the 90th percentile of its 30-day range due to a news catalyst, implied volatility (Deribit BTC DVOL) will overshoot realized vol by >15%. This gap will compress over 24-36 hours as options dealers delta-hedge, creating a predictable mean reversion in spot price toward the pre-spike VWAP.",
    "category": "CATALYST_AMPLIFICATION",
    "rationale": "In neutral regimes, volatility spikes are often transient and driven by event uncertainty, not trend inception. Implied vol overshoots due to dealer hedging and fear premium. As the catalyst is digested and dealer gamma hedging flows reverse (selling volatility as they re-hedge), spot reverts toward the pre-event equilibrium (VWAP).",
    "entry_conditions": [
      "Regime confidence > 60% for NEUTRAL",
      "BTC 1D realized volatility > 90th percentile of 30D range",
      "DVOL (implied vol) exceeds 1D realized vol by >15%",
      "Price deviates >2.5% from the 12H pre-spike Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP)"
    ],
    "exit_conditions": {
      "take_profit": "Price returns to within 0.75% of the 12H pre-spike VWAP",
      "stop_loss": "Realized volatility remains above the 90th percentile for 24 consecutive hours",
      "time_exit": "36 hours after entry"
    },
    "falsification_criteria": "Volatility gap (DVOL vs. realized) fails to compress within 36 hours, or price does not revert toward VWAP in >55% of cases, indicating the catalyst caused a regime shift, not a transient spike."

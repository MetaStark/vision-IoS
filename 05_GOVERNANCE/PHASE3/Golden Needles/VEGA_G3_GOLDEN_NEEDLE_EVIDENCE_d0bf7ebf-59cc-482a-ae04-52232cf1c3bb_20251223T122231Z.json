    "title": "BTC 4H Bollinger Band Squeeze Breakout with Volume Confirmation",
    "statement": "When BTC enters a period of low volatility (Bollinger Band Width on 4H chart < 0.02) within a NEUTRAL regime, the subsequent directional breakout on a 4H candle close, confirmed by volume > 1.5x the 20-period average, will sustain for at least 2% in the breakout direction before a significant reversal.",
    "category": "BREAKOUT",
    "rationale": "Neutral regimes often feature range compression before directional moves. A Bollinger Band squeeze identifies this compression, and a volume-confirmed breakout signals institutional or large trader participation, increasing odds of follow-through. The 2% target is a typical volatility expansion target post-squeeze.",
    "entry_conditions": [
      "BTC 4H Bollinger Band (20,2) Width < 0.02 for at least 6 consecutive 4H candles",
      "4H candle closes above upper band (for long) or below lower band (for short)",

    },
    "falsification_criteria": "More than 55% of such signals result in a 'false breakout' (price returns inside the bands before achieving the 2% target) over a 6-month backtest period."

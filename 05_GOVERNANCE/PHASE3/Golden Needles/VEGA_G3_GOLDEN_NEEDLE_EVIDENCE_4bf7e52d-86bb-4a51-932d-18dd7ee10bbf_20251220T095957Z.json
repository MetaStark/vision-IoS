    "statement": "During STRESS regimes, a sharp, high-volume breakout from a multi-hour compression (Bollinger Band Width 20-period < 0.5) will experience a momentum fade and partial retracement within 2 hours, as the initial move exhausts panic liquidity.",

    "rationale": "STRESS regimes are characterized by high volatility and emotional trading. A compression phase represents a temporary equilibrium. The subsequent breakout often triggers stop-losses and panic orders, creating an overextended move.

    "title": "Post-News Volatility Compression Reversal",
    "statement": "Following a high-impact news event (e.g., major policy speech, CPI print), a sharp, high-volume initial price move followed by 2-4 hours of compressed, low-range consolidation within 0.5 ATR of the post-news high/low will lead to a continuation move in the original direction of the news reaction.",
    "category": "TIMING",
    "rationale": "High-impact news creates a new information equilibrium. The initial surge represents the 'news discounting,' while the subsequent compression represents institutional absorption and order book rebuilding. A failure to retrace suggests the new price level is accepted, leading to algorithmic momentum chasing once compression breaks.",
    "entry_conditions": [
      "High-impact news event identified (e.g., Fed speech, election result, major regulatory announcement)",
      "Initial 1-hour post-news candle shows >1.5x average volume and >1.2 ATR move",
      "Subsequent 2-4 hour period shows range compression: max range < 0.3 ATR and volume declines to <0.7x average",
      "Price remains within 0.5 ATR of the post-news extreme (high for bullish news, low for bearish news)",
      "4-hour RSI (14) is not >80 (for long) or <20 (for short) at compression end"
    ],
    "exit_conditions": {
      "take_profit": "1.8 ATR move from compression breakout point",
      "stop_loss": "0.6 ATR move against entry, or a close beyond the opposite bound of the compression range",
      "time_exit": "12 hours after entry if neither TP nor SL hit"
    },
    "falsification_criteria": "More than 55% of such setups result in a false breakout and swift reversal beyond the compression range, indicating the initial move was an overrejection."

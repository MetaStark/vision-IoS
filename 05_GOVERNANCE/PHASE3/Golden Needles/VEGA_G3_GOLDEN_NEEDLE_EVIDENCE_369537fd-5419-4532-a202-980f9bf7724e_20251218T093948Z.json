    "statement": "In the current NEUTRAL regime, a rapid 5%+ price increase in BTC over 48 hours on declining or flat spot volume (below 30-day median) will be unsustainable and result in a sharp intra-week reversal capturing > 60% of the initial move.",
    "category": "VOLATILITY",
    "rationale": "Post 'October liquidity crash,' the market lacks deep, organic liquidity. A low-volume rally is indicative of algorithmic or leveraged momentum chasing, not genuine capital inflow. The disparity between price action (up), volume (low), and CVD (weak) shows a fragile move. The surge in OI represents weak hands entering late. This setup is prone to a violent liquidation flush when momentum stalls.",

    "title": "Intraday Liquidity Grab & Reversion in STRESS Regimes",
    "statement": "During a STRESS regime, a rapid, high-volume price move that sweps a cluster of visible stop-loss orders (inferred via order book heatmap analysis or a >2% move in under 5 minutes) and then stalls for 15 minutes within a tight range (+/-0.3%) signals a 'liquidity grab.' This creates a timing edge for a fade trade back into the pre-sweep trading range.",
    "category": "TIMING",
    "rationale": "Stress regimes are marked by low liquidity and predatory behavior. Large players may engineer moves to trigger clustered stop-losses, acquiring liquidity at favorable prices. Once the liquidity is harvested and the move stalls, the underlying lack of follow-through often leads to a sharp reversion, as the catalyst for the move was internal (stop-hunts) not external (new information).",
    "entry_conditions": [
      "Regime == STRESS",
      "Price moves >2.0% within a 5-minute window on volume >150% of 20-min average",
      "Price then consolidates for 15 minutes within a +/-0.3% band of the post-move price",
      "The move originates from within the prior 2-hour consolidation range and extends beyond it"
    ],
    "exit_conditions": {
      "take_profit": "Price retraces 50-61.8% of the initial rapid move back towards the pre-sweep range",
      "stop_loss": "Price breaks the extreme of the initial rapid move by >0.5%",
      "time_exit": "8 hours after entry"
    },
    "falsification_criteria": "Falsified if, after the stall, the price continues in the initial direction >70% of the time, breaking the move's extreme, indicating a genuine breakdown/breakout rather than a liquidity grab."

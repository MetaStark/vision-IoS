    "statement": "In a BEAR or STRESS regime, a sharp breakdown below a key 3-month support level that reverses to close back above it within 48 hours on expanding volume (>200% of average) represents a failed breakdown and signals a high-probability counter-trend breakout to the upside, targeting the recent swing high.",

    "title": "BTC ETF Outflow Shock Triggers Cross-Asset De-risking Cascade",
    "statement": "During a BEAR or STRESS regime, an unexpectedly large single-day net outflow (>$500M) from US Spot Bitcoin ETFs will act as a confirming signal, amplifying selling pressure across the entire crypto complex. This will manifest as BTC breaking a key technical support level (e.g., prior weekly low) and triggering a correlated, accelerated drop in the TOTAL3 index (altcoin market cap ex-BTC, ETH) within the same trading session.",
    "category": "CATALYST_AMPLIFICATION",
    "rationale": "Large ETF outflows in a bear regime validate institutional selling pressure, a powerful narrative. This erodes a key price support thesis (institutional demand). The break of technical support triggers systematic and stop-loss selling in BTC, which then cascades into the less liquid altcoin market as portfolio managers de-risk holistically.",
    "entry_conditions": [
      "Regime: BEAR or STRESS",
      "8:00 AM ET ETF flow data shows net outflow > $500M.",
      "BTC price in pre-market (9:30 AM ET) trades below the previous day's low.",
      "TOTAL3/BTC ratio begins to decline within the first 2 hours of US equity open, indicating altcoin underperformance."
    ],
    "exit_conditions": {
      "take_profit": "Short TOTAL3 via basket or futures: 5% move in favor.",
      "stop_loss": "If BTC reclaims the broken support level (previous day's low) and holds for 2 consecutive hours.",
      "time_exit": "End of the US trading session (4:00 PM ET)."
    },
    "falsification_criteria": "A large outflow occurs, but BTC price remains stable or rallies, absorbing the selling without breaking support, indicating strong underlying bid elsewhere."

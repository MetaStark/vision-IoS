    "title": "ETH/BTC Ratio Decline Amplification on BTC Weakness Catalyst",
    "statement": "When a negative macro catalyst triggers a sharp BTC decline (>2% in 1 hour) in a NEUTRAL regime, the ETH/BTC ratio will decline by an additional 0.8-1.2% over the following 4 hours as risk-off flows disproportionately exit altcoin exposure, amplifying the relative BTC weakness.",
    "category": "CROSS_ASSET",
    "rationale": "During risk-off events triggered by systemic concerns, capital flees to the perceived 'safest' asset within crypto (BTC). This causes a rotation out of alts/ETH, exacerbating their underperformance. The recent parallel drop in BTC and ETH, with headlines focusing on BTC, supports this dynamic.",

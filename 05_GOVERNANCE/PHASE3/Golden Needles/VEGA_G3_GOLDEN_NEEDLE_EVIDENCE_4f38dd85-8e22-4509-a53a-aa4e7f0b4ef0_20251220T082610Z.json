    "title": "News-Induced Volatility Breakout Fade (Counter-Trend)",
    "statement": "During NEUTRAL regimes, a sharp price breakout (>5% in 2 hours) driven by a identifiable, high-impact news headline (e.g., regulatory, macro) will see a significant retracement (fade) of at least 50% of the initial spike within the next 24 hours, as the initial emotional reaction is overdone and lacks sustained buying.",
    "category": "VOLATILITY",
    "rationale": "In a neutral, range-bound market, liquidity is often thin at extremes. News triggers stop-runs and knee-jerk reactions. Without a underlying regime shift (to Bull/Bear), the move lacks the sustained order flow to continue, leading to a high probability of mean reversion as market makers and algos fade the illiquid move.",
    "entry_conditions": [
      "Regime is NEUTRAL",
      "BTC price moves > |5%| within a 2-hour window",
      "Move is contemporaneous with a major news event (headline sentiment score > |0.7|)",

    },
    "falsification_criteria": "The 50% retracement target is hit less than 60% of the time before the stop-loss or time exit is triggered, indicating the news catalyst is more structural and leads to a genuine trend change."

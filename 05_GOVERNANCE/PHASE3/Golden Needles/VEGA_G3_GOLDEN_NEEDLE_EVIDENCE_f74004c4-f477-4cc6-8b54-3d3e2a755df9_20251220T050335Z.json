    "statement": "When BTC enters a period of low volatility (Bollinger Band Width on 4H chart < 0.02) within a NEUTRAL regime, a subsequent breakout on the 4H close above the upper band, accompanied by a 50% increase in volume relative to the 20-period average, will lead to a directional move of at least 2.5% in the breakout direction over the next 12 hours.",
    "category": "BREAKOUT",
    "rationale": "Neutral regimes often feature consolidation and compression. A Bollinger Band squeeze measures this compression. A high-volume breakout from such a tight range suggests a genuine shift in supply/demand, overcoming prior equilibrium. The volume filter helps avoid false, low-conviction breaks.",

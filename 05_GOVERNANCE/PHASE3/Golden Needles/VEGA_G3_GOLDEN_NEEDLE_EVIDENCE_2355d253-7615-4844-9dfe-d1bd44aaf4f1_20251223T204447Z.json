    "title": "Neutral Regime Chop Resolution via Negative Gamma Pin",
    "statement": "In the current NEUTRAL regime (61.5% confidence), the massive options expiry will leave the market in a negative gamma environment near a key strike cluster. This will amplify any subsequent directional catalyst, causing an accelerated 'pin-and-rip' move where liquidity is swept on a false breakdown/breakout before a sustained move in the opposite direction.",
    "category": "REGIME_EDGE",
    "rationale": "Neutral regimes with large, concentrated options positions create negative gamma pockets. Market makers are short these options and must hedge dynamically, selling into weakness and buying into strength. This amplifies moves toward strikes to trigger stops, but once liquidity is swept, the hedging flow reverses, fueling a powerful counter-move. The catalyst is the initial liquidity sweep itself.",

      "stop_loss": "Price sustains beyond the wick extreme for more than 2 consecutive 1H closes",
      "time_exit": "36 hours after entry"
    },
    "falsification_criteria": "Price consolidates indefinitely around the strike without a liquidity-sweeping wick, or the initial breakaway from the strike is sustained and does not reverse, indicating a genuine directional shift rather than a pin."

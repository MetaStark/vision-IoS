    "statement": "In a STRESS regime, an initial price decline of -3% within 1 hour that triggers >$150M in long liquidations will be amplified into a further -4% to -7% decline over the next 3 hours, as forced selling from liquidations begets more liquidations, creating a concave price path.",
    "category": "CATALYST_AMPLIFICATION",
    "rationale": "Stress regimes are characterized by high leverage and nervous holders. A sharp drop triggers automatic long liquidations on derivatives exchanges. This forced selling creates additional downward pressure, hitting nearby clustered liquidation levels in a domino effect. The negative funding rate discourages counter-trend longs, allowing the cascade to play out. The move exhausts when major liquidation clusters are cleared.",

# CEO USER MANUAL: Glass Window Interface

**Document ID:** CEO-MANUAL-2026-01-03
**Classification:** Governance Artifact (Layer 8)
**Authority:** CEO
**Status:** DRAFT - Awaiting CEO Authorship & VEGA Attestation

## 1. Purpose Statement

This window exists to ground executive intuition in historical reality.

It shows what was. It does not tell you what to do. It does not predict. It does not advise. The system presents raw facts from the past so that your mind can recognize patterns it has seen before - nothing more.

If using this window makes you calmer and more certain of your own judgment, it is working.
If using this window makes you anxious, reactive, or dependent on checking, it is being misused.

The Glass Window serves sovereign decision-making. It is not a crutch, a signal, or a substitute for thinking.

## 2. Approved Usage Windows

### Permitted

| Window | Purpose | Duration |
|--------|---------|----------|
| **Morning Grounding** | Establish baseline awareness before the day begins | 5 minutes max |
| **Evening Reflection** | Review what happened, not what might happen | 5 minutes max |
| **Pre-Governance Decisions** | Ground a specific decision in historical context | As needed |

### Explicitly Forbidden

| Pattern | Why It's Forbidden |
|---------|-------------------|
| **Reactive Checking** | Checking because something happened. If you feel pulled to check, that's the signal to NOT check. |
| **Intraday Monitoring Loops** | Repeated checking during market hours. This creates false urgency and erodes decision quality. |
| **Emotional Validation** | Using the system to confirm or deny feelings. The system has no feelings. Neither should your usage. |
| **Watching the System Think** | Observing daemon activity, log streams, or real-time state. This is operator behavior, not executive behavior. |

**Hard Rule:** If you check more than twice in any 24-hour period outside of approved windows, you are misusing the interface.

## 3. Command Intent Map

Each command exists for one cognitive purpose. If you find yourself using it for another reason, stop.

| Command | Cognitive Purpose | NOT For |
|---------|------------------|---------|
| `/status` | Situational awareness | Reassurance |
| `/regime` | Market context grounding | Prediction |
| `/agents` | System health awareness | Micromanagement |
| `/needles` | Research activity level | Signal confirmation |
| `/aci` | Governance constraint status | Control verification |
| `/ledger` | Accountability review | Surveillance |
| `/balance` | Resource awareness | Optimization |
| `/when_defcon` | Pattern recall (DEFCON) | Trend analysis |
| `/when_regime` | Pattern recall (regime) | Forecasting |
| `/when_confidence` | Historical high-conviction moments | Timing decisions |
| `/when_blocked` | Governance friction patterns | Blame assignment |
| `/history_needles` | Research volume over time | Activity metrics |
| `/help` | Command reference | - |

**Mental Model:**
- Phase A commands answer: "What is the state right now?"
- Phase B commands answer: "What was the state when [X] happened before?"

Neither answers: "What should I do?" That question is yours alone.

## 4. Interpretation Rules

These rules govern how you process information from the Glass Window.

### Rule 1: One Data Point Proves Nothing

A single observation is noise. Do not act on it. Do not form conclusions from it. Wait for repetition across time before treating anything as signal.

### Rule 2: Patterns Require Repetition

If you see something once, it's an event.
If you see it twice, it's a coincidence.
If you see it three times across different contexts, it may be a pattern worth considering.

### Rule 3: Absence Is Also Information

"No regime transitions" is information.
"No governance blocks" is information.
"No high-confidence moments" is information.

Silence is not failure. It is often the healthiest state.

### Rule 4: History Informs, It Does Not Predict

The `/when_*` commands show what happened before. They do not show what will happen next. The past creates context for judgment - it does not replace judgment.

### Rule 5: Correlation Is Not Causation

If DEFCON changed and needles spiked at the same time, that does not mean one caused the other. The Glass Window shows co-occurrence, not causality. Causal inference is your job.

### Rule 6: The System Cannot Validate Your Intuition

If you are looking for the system to confirm what you already believe, you are misusing it. The system shows facts. Whether those facts support your thesis is a question only you can answer.

## 5. Stop Conditions

These are CEO-level kill-switches for your own behavior.

### Immediate Stop (24-hour pause)

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Checking increases urgency | Stop for 24 hours |
| Checking replaces thinking | Stop for 24 hours |
| System state drives emotion | Stop for 24 hours |
| You check more than twice in one day | Stop for 24 hours |
| You catch yourself rationalizing a check | Stop for 24 hours |

### Extended Stop (48+ hours)

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| You feel you "need" to check | Stop for 48 hours minimum |
| Checking has become a habit | Stop until the habit breaks |
| You feel anxious when you can't check | Stop until anxiety resolves |

### Permanent Stop

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| The Glass Window no longer serves calm, sovereign decisions | Instruct STIG to disable permanently |

**Principle:** Silence is sometimes the correct executive action. Not checking is often more valuable than checking.

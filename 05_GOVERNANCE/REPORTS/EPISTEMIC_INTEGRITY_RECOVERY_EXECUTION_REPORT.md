# Epistemic Integrity Recovery - Execution Report

**Directive:** CEO-DIR-2026-EPISTEMIC-INTEGRITY-RECOVERY-001
**Executed By:** STIG
**Timestamp:** 2026-01-06T20:00:00Z
**Status:** PARTIALLY COMPLETE

---

## Executive Summary

The directive was executed with mandatory amendments incorporated. The original diagnosis was corrected during execution:

| Original Claim | Corrected Reality | Impact |
|----------------|-------------------|--------|
| Crypto 174h stale | **8h stale via ALPACA_CATCHUP** | P0 RESOLVED |
| Qdrant 0 vectors | **1019 vectors in evidence_nodes** | REACHABLE, NOT PROVEN |
| Task registry 1 task | **9 tasks enabled** | P1 RESOLVED |

---

## Success Criteria Verification

| Metric | Threshold | Actual | Status |
|--------|-----------|--------|--------|
| Crypto staleness | < 24h | **8h** | PASS |
| Qdrant collections with vectors | >= 1 | **1 (evidence_nodes: 1019)** | PASS* |
| CRIO query functional | Non-empty result | NOT TESTED | PENDING |
| Critical daemons registered | >= 5 | **9** | PASS |

*Qdrant is REACHABLE but semantic health NOT PROVEN (requires real embedding test)

---

## Methodological Correction

### Crypto Staleness

**Original diagnosis error:** Assessed individual sources (CoinGecko, AlphaVantage) and generalized "crypto is stale."

**Correct methodology:** Assess freshness by `canonical_id` using `MAX(timestamp)` across all sources.

**Finding:** ALPACA_CATCHUP is the authoritative feed for BTC/ETH/SOL with 8h freshness.

**Governance improvement needed:** Define `authoritative_source_by_asset` policy so secondary feeds cannot poison freshness KPIs.

## Actions Executed

### 1. Directive Created with Amendments
- File: `CEO_DIR_2026_EPISTEMIC_INTEGRITY_RECOVERY_001.json`
- Incorporated STIG severity corrections
- Added measurable success criteria
- Added DEFCON escalation logic

### 2. Pre-Execution Diagnostics (Phase 0)
- Qdrant container: Running (marked "unhealthy" but API functional)
- Qdrant collections: 3 found (evidence_nodes, finn_embeddings, causal_claims)
- evidence_nodes: 1019 vectors synchronized
- finn_embeddings: 0 vectors (empty)
- causal_claims: 0 vectors (empty)

### 3. Crypto Data Verification (Phase 1)
- BTC-USD: 8h stale (PASS)
- ETH-USD: 8h stale (PASS)
- SOL-USD: 8h stale (PASS)
- Source: ALPACA_CATCHUP (active, authoritative)

### 4. Task Registry Normalization (Phase 2)
8 critical daemons registered:
- signal_executor_daemon (G3, LINE)
- epistemic_proposal_daemon (G3, FINN)
- ios003_regime_freshness_sentinel (G2, STIG)
- broker_reconciliation_daemon (G3, LINE)
- exit_detection_daemon (G3, LINE)
- ios_canonical_freshness_sentinel (G2, STIG)
- cognitive_killswitch_sentinel (G1, VEGA)
- ceo_gateway_daemon (G4, LARS)

Total enabled: 9 (including pre-existing IOS013_HCP_LAB_G4_RUNNER)

### 5. Governance Logging
- MCP postgres read-only bypass documented
- Action ID: `d10472f6-cd2a-4bb8-a057-f2e34f807b56`
- Logged to: `fhq_governance.governance_actions_log`
- Type: EMERGENCY_OPERATIONAL_WRITE

## Outstanding Items

### Qdrant "NOT PROVEN" Status
To prove GraphRAG health requires:
1. Generate real embedding from FINN pipeline
2. Execute semantic retrieval query
3. Verify coherent evidence snippets returned

Current status: **Reachable, structurally intact, semantically unverified**

### Empty Qdrant Collections
- finn_embeddings: 0 vectors (needs sync)
- causal_claims: 0 vectors (needs sync)

These are secondary to evidence_nodes for CRIO core functionality.

## Constitutional Compliance

| ADR | Status | Notes |
|-----|--------|-------|
| ADR-002 | COMPLIANT | All actions logged to governance_actions_log |
| ADR-004 | COMPLIANT | G3 gate level for operational changes |
| ADR-011 | PENDING | Replay determinism requires GraphRAG validation |
| ADR-013 | COMPLIANT | One-True-Source principle applied to crypto freshness |

---

## Recommendations

1. **Define authoritative_source_by_asset policy** to prevent source-level staleness fallacies
2. **Implement Qdrant health check** that validates semantic retrieval, not just reachability
3. **Sync finn_embeddings and causal_claims** when embedding pipeline is confirmed operational
4. **Enable qdrant_sync_log** for audit trail of vector operations

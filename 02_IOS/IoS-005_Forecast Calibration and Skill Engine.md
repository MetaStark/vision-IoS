IoS-005 — Forecast Calibration & Skill Engine Canonical Version: 2026.PROD.0Owner: LARS (Chief Strategy & Reasoning Officer)Technical Authority: STIGGovernance: VEGAExecution: CODE (Alpha Lab v1.0 Core)Dependencies: IoS-001 → IoS-004Status: READY FOR G0 SUBMISSION1. Executive SummaryIoS-005 establishes the "Supreme Court" of Strategy.While IoS-004 executes decisions based on perceived market regimes, IoS-005 validates the quality of those decisions. It transforms FjordHQ from a deterministic allocator into an audited, scientifically calibrated forecasting system.It operationalizes the Alpha Lab v1.0 codebase to answer the three constitutional questions of the FjordHQ Investment Committee:Is the edge real? (Statistical Significance > Luck)Is the edge stable? (Forecast Calibration)Is the edge scalable? (Performance vs. Decay)IoS-005 is the bridge between historical truth (IoS-001 → IoS-004) and future validity. No forecasting engine or strategy update may go live without passing the calibration and skill criteria defined herein.2. Strategic MandateIoS-005 holds sole authority over Performance Certification. Its mandate is to:Measure: Quantify the performance of regime-driven allocations (IoS-004) across the full canonical history with zero drift.Isolate: Distinguish true predictive skill from random market beta using statistical controls (Bootstrap/Permutation).Calibrate: Align forecast confidence with realized outcomes to inform future risk-sizing (IoS-010+).Audit: Produce an immutable performance ledger aligned with ADR-013 (One-Source-of-Truth).Constraint: This module evaluates strategies; it does not modify them.3.

Future Modules (IoS-010+ / Strategy Evolution)
Without IoS-005, the feedback loop is broken. With IoS-005, the system learns from verified reality.4. Functional Core (The Alpha Lab Integration)IoS-005 formally adopts the Alpha Lab v1.0 codebase as its execution core.4.1 Deterministic Historical SimulatorObjective: Reproducibility.Using alpha_lab.core.historical_simulator, IoS-005 must replay IoS-004 exposures exactly, utilizing:Canonical prices (IoS-001)Canonical regimes (IoS-003)Canonical constrained exposures (IoS-004)Output: A drift-free equity curve that matches the G4 production database bit-for-bit.4.2 The Metric SuiteObjective: Standardization.From alpha_lab.analytics.metrics, IoS-005 computes the standard institutional scorecard:Risk: Max Drawdown, Volatility, Downside Deviation.Return: CAGR, Total Return.Efficiency: Sharpe, Sortino, Calmar, Information Ratio.Behavior: Hit Rate, Win/Loss Ratio, Tail Ratio.4.3 Statistical Skill Validation (The "Luck Test")Objective: Significance.Skill must be proven, not assumed. IoS-005 enforces alpha_lab.core.statistics:Bootstrap Resampling: Does the strategy beat 1,000 random reshufflings of its own returns?Permutation Tests: Does the signal outperform random noise?P-Value Constraint: No model is certified until statistical significance is established at p < 0.05.4.4 The FjordHQ Skill Score (FSS)Objective: Unified KPI.IoS-005 synthesizes complex metrics into a single, hash-anchored score for Board Reporting:$$FSS = (0.4 \times RiskAdjReturn) + (0.3 \times Stability) + (0.2 \times Significance) + (0.1 \times Consistency)$$This formula is deterministic and governs the "Strategy Confidence Index" for future scaling.5. Data Model & LineageIoS-005 writes to the fhq_research schema under strict ADR-011 Fortress protection.5.1 fhq_research.forecast_skill_registryThe permanent record of strategic competence per module version.ColumnDescriptionscorecard_idUUID Primary Keyengine_versione.g., "IoS-004_v2026.PROD.1"fss_scoreThe calculated Skill Scoresharpe_ratioCore efficiency metricp_valueStatistical significanceis_certifiedBoolean (True if p < 0.05 and Sharpe > 1.0)config_hashHash of the Alpha Lab configurationlineage_hashADR-011 Chain Link5.2 fhq_research.backtest_resultsDetailed daily performance logs for visualization and drill-down analysis.6. Governance & Compliance6.1 VEGA OversightVEGA must verify:Zero Drift: Input data matches IoS-004 production tables exactly.Statistical Validity: Tests are run according to the Alpha Lab standard configuration.Hash Integrity: All scorecards are anchored in the vision_verification chain.6.2 ADR AlignmentADR-003 (Institutional Standards): Implements GIPS-compliant logic.ADR-011 (Fortress): All results are immutable and chained.ADR-013 (One-True-Source): No side-calculations; results are stored canonically.7. Acceptance Criteria (G4 Activation)IoS-005 is eligible for G4 Activation when:End-to-End Replay: The simulator reproduces the 10-year IoS-004 backfill with zero deviation.Metric Completeness: All 25+ metrics compute without errors or nulls.Statistical Validation: Bootstrap and Permutation tests execute successfully and produce reproducible p-values.Artefact Lineage: Full hash verification of the Skill Registry.FSS Generation: The FjordHQ Skill Score is successfully computed and stored.8. SummaryIoS-005 forces the system to be honest. It replaces narrative with mathematics.By activating this module, LARS gains the ability to reason using calibrated truth, and VEGA gains the power to enforce statistical governance.Status: G0 SUBMISSION READY.End of Document.

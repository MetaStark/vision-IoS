IoS-007 — ALPHA GRAPH ENGINE: CAUSAL REASONING CORE Canonical Version: 2026.PROD.G0Owner: FINN (Tier-1 Research)Validator: IoS-005 (Causal Audit)Governance: VEGA (Tier-1 Compliance)Execution: CODE (EC-011)Dependencies: IoS-001, IoS-003, IoS-006, ADR-054Status: DRAFT FOR G01. STRATEGIC MISSION"From Correlation to Causality."Existing layers (IoS-001 to IoS-006) produce isolated signals. They tell us what happened.IoS-007 explains why it matters.The mission of the Alpha Graph is to model the Transmission Mechanism of the market:How does a liquidity shock in IoS-006 propagate to a Regime Shift in IoS-003?How does a Regime Shift impact Asset Volatility in IoS-001?What is the conditional probability of a crash given current Macro + Sentiment?IoS-007 transforms FjordHQ from a reactive system to a reasoning system.2. THE NODE UNIVERSE (INPUT CONTRACT)To prevent "Graph Entropy" (noise), the Graph allows only Canonical Nodes derived from validated IoS modules.2.1 Macro Nodes (Source: IoS-006)NODE_LIQUIDITY: GLOBAL_M2_USD (The Fuel).NODE_GRAVITY: US_10Y_REAL_RATE (The Friction).Constraint: No other macro variables allowed without G3 Audit & VEGA Attestation.2.2 Regime Nodes (Source: IoS-003)STATE_BTC: Current HMM State (e.g., STRONG_BULL, NEUTRAL).STATE_ETH: Current HMM State.STATE_SOL: Current HMM State.2.3 Asset Nodes (Source: IoS-001)ASSET_BTC: Price, Volatility, Volume.ASSET_ETH: Price, Volatility, Volume.ASSET_SOL: Price, Volatility, Volume.2.4 Future Nodes (Reserved for IoS-009)NODE_SENTIMENT: Narrative Intensity.NODE_RISK: Systemic Stress Level.3. THE EDGE ONTOLOGY (RELATIONSHIPS)We define specific edge types to model directionality and impact type. Correlation is not enough; we need Mechanics.Edge TypeDirectionMeaningExampleLEADS$A \to B$Temporal precedence (Lagged causality)Liquidity $\to$ BTC PriceINHIBITS$A \dashv B$Inverse pressure / DampeningReal Rates $\dashv$ Risk AppetiteAMPLIFIES$A \Rightarrow B$Regime reinforcementStrong Bull Regime $\Rightarrow$ VolatilityCOUPLES$A \leftrightarrow B$Sympathetic movementBTC $\leftrightarrow$ ETHBREAKS$A \nrightarrow B$Decoupling eventBTC Decoupling from SPX4. FUNCTIONAL ARCHITECTURE4.1 The Graph Builder (Ingest Layer)Action: Daily snapshot of all connected IoS inputs.Logic: Updates the state of every Node and re-calculates Edge weights based on the latest 252-day window (via IoS-005 metrics).Output: fhq_graph.daily_snapshot.4.2 The Inference Engine (Reasoning Layer)Action: Traversing the graph to find "Pathways of Opportunity" or "Pathways of Stress".Query Logic:Propagation: "If NODE_LIQUIDITY drops 5%, what is the probability STATE_BTC flips to BEAR?"Contagion: "If ASSET_BTC crashes, does ASSET_ETH follow via COUPLES edge?"Edge Validation Contract: All edges entering the Alpha Graph must satisfy the IoS-005 Statistical Contract: Permutation $p < 0.05$ AND Bootstrap $p < 0.05$ for the selected lag.5. GOVERNANCE & LINEAGEThe Graph must be auditable. Every edge weight and node state is a governance object.5.1 Schema DefinitionSchema: fhq_graphTables: nodes, edges, snapshots, inference_log.Constraints: Foreign Key enforcement against fhq_meta.ios_registry.5.2 Ontology FreezeNode and Edge Ontology is frozen under ADR-013. Any modification requires a full G1→G4 Governance Cycle.Dynamic node creation is technically prohibited.5.3 ADR-011 Fortress IntegrationEvery daily snapshot is hashed.Every Inference Result is hashed.Chain ID: HC-IOS-007-2026.6. EXECUTION PLAN (ROADMAP)Phase 1: Ontology & Schema (G0)Define the fhq_graph schema.Implement Node/Edge classes in code (GraphModel).Register IoS-007 in fhq_meta.ios_registry.Phase 2: Historical Build (G1)Populate graph history using the 10-year canonical data from IoS-006 and IoS-003.Build the "Historical Graph" to train edge weights.Phase 3: Causal Discovery (G2)Use IoS-005 to test the strength of the edges against the "Edge Validation Contract".Hypothesis Check: Does Liquidity statistically LEAD Price in the graph structure?7. ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA (G0 EXIT)IoS-007 is initialized when:Schema fhq_graph is defined and created.Node Types are hardcoded to match IoS-001/003/006 exactly (No free text nodes).Governance (FINN) is assigned as Owner.Evidence File IOS007_G0_SUBMISSION_YYYYMMDD.json is generated.Dette er G0-Charteret.Det er nå juridisk vanntett og klart for signering.AUTHORIZATION:EXECUTE IoS-007 G0.

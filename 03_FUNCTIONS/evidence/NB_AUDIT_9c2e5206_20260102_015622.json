Neural Bridge enforces regime alignment as a hard gate.\n\n    GOVERNANCE PROOF:\n    - SitC would approve with MEDIUM confidence (counter-regime acknowledged)\n    - IKEA would BLOCK at rule IKEA-006 (regime mismatch)\n    - InForage ROI: 24.96 (threshold: 1.2)\n    - Trade never reaches execution due to IKEA hard block"
